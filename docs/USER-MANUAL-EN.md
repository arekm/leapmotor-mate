# LeapMotor Mate — User Manual

> **Mate version:** v4.14.1 · **Language:** English

## New in 4.14.1

**A reading stays with its car.** On an account with two cars, a reading Mate took after a command, or
with the 🔄 Refresh button, could be filed under the other car if you switched car in the sidebar while
the cloud was answering: that car then showed a day with thousands of kilometres and a standby loss it
never had. The reading now always goes under the car it was read from (#338). A row already filed under
the wrong car stays where it is.

### New in 4.14.0

**Mate no longer writes a charge's note.** Until now, with the default settings, Mate wrote a note on
every charge it closed — the address, the times, the temperatures — and to find the address it sent the
position of every charge away from home to OpenStreetMap, even with the address lookup switched off.
Both stop: the note is yours, as a trip's has been since 4.13.0, and the notes written before stay as
they are. The times are in the charge's heading, the temperatures on its chart and the address on its 📍
line. A charge with no address there yet, an older one for instance, has **🧭** beside 📍: it asks the
provider chosen in *Settings → Address lookup* at once, even with the switch off, and draws the line
again; when no address comes, a row under it says why. *Write the note by itself* is gone from that
card. The 🧭 of a trip also says why no address came: the provider has nothing there, or how asking it
failed. By @arekm (#406).

**Mate inside Home Assistant from a Docker install.** With hass_ingress in its default `ingress` mode,
put the address you open Home Assistant with in `MATE_FRAME_ANCESTORS`. The README now says what a Mate
password does inside a frame (#407).

### New in 4.13.1

**Every charge shows where it happened.** Beside 📍 a charge shows the station with its address after
it; without a station, your charging place there, with "(charging place)", or the address — a charge at
home included. The addresses come from the same lookup as the trips', so a charge where a trip already
ended costs no request; the switch in *Settings → Address lookup*, now called **Look up the addresses of
trips and charges**, covers both. Charges older than three days are not looked up by themselves. The
search on Charges and on Events finds a charge by its address, town or postcode, and the charges CSV
gains `place` and `address`. A merged trip whose last piece ended in the last three days now has its
start looked up even when its first piece ended earlier. By @arekm (#405).

### New in 4.13.0

**Trips show where they started and ended.** A trip's row reads "A → B", the *Trip summary* on its
page names both ends, and so do the trip's start and end rows in Events. An end inside one of your
charging places shows its name with "(charging place)"; elsewhere it is the address. Mate looks the
addresses up shortly after a trip ends, with the provider set in *Settings → Address lookup*; the new
switch **Look up where trips start and end** there turns that off, and after the update it starts as
**Write the note by itself** was. Trips older than three days are not looked up by themselves: 🧭 beside
a missing address in the *Trip summary* looks that trip up at once. The search finds a trip by either
end, and the trips CSV gains `start_place` and `end_place`. Mate no longer writes a trip's note by
itself — **Write the note by itself** now covers charges only — and the notes it wrote before stay as
they are. By @arekm (#404).

### New in 4.12.1

**A reload stays on the month you are looking at.** In the Trips, Charges, Wallbox and Refuels
calendars the month on screen goes into the page's address (for example `?month=2026-09`), so a
reload — yours, or the one the page does by itself — comes back to that month, with the day or range
you had open; it used to go back to the current month. The browser's Back after opening a trip does
the same. **Jump to today** takes the month out of the address again. When a charge ends, the Charges
page reloads itself and now stays on the month you are looking at: the new charge is in the current
month, one click on **Jump to today** away. On Refuels, adding or deleting a refuel redraws the month
on screen, no longer the current one. By @arekm (#403).

### New in 4.12.0

**Several days at once in the Trips calendar.** A week, a weekend or a holiday opens in one gesture:
on a computer **Shift-click** a second day, or **drag** the mouse across the days; on a phone **hold** a
day — a dashed ring marks it — and then **tap** the last one. The drawer opens with one heading for
the whole range — battery, driving time, kilometres and the rest of a day's figures — and under it
each day with trips, newest first, with its own heading. A range stays inside the month on screen. A
day's date under the range opens that day alone, with its 🔗 button for merging trips, which a range
does not have. The other calendars keep one day per click. A line under the Trips calendar names the
three gestures. By @arekm (#402).

When the car charged between the first trip and the last — over a few days it almost always has —
the range's battery reads as a day's does with a charge in it: what the trips used and what the
charges added, and either figure says what it counts when you hold the pointer on it or tap it. So the
range's figure need not equal its days' figures added up: a day with no charge goes from its first
reading to its last, and also counts what the car lost while parked between its trips.

**The drawer shows the day you picked last.** Two days picked in quick succession sent two requests
side by side, and a slow answer for the first day could fill the drawer under the second day's ring —
on all four calendars. Now a new pick replaces the request still on its way, and a failed day's **Try
again** strip goes once you ask for another day. By @arekm (#402).

### New in 4.11.2

**The sunshade carries the official app's name in every language.** In English, the Vehicle and
Commands tiles called it the "Panoramic roof" and the confirmations "panoramic roof shade"; it is now
the **Sunshade** there too ("Open the sunshade?"), as Events and the notice shown while driving
already said. The other languages take the app's names as well (#391), and the Vehicle tile says
"open" and "closed" in words that agree with them. Nothing changes in Home Assistant.

### New in 4.11.1

**In Italian, the sunshade is the «Parasole».** The Italian pages called it three things: «Tetto
panoramico» on the Vehicle and Commands tiles, «tendina» in Events and in the confirmations, and
«parasole» in the notice shown while driving. They now say «Parasole» everywhere, the name the
official app gives it. Nothing changes in English or in Home Assistant.

### New in 4.11.0

**The T03 gets its windows back on Commands.** Since 4.0.0 Mate looked for the windows code that the
B10 and the C10 declare, and a T03 declares a different one: on a T03 the **Windows** tile on Commands
hid its **Open** / **Close** button, and the slider it left answered *"Command not sent"*. Either code
now lets the command through, and a T03 gets the position on its own 0–100 scale. Not yet tried on a
T03 (#400). Where the car itself does not allow the windows, the slider now hides together with the
button.

**Mate starts on a NAS shared folder.** From 4.0.0, a data folder that does not keep file permissions
— a NAS shared folder with its own access rules can be one — stopped Mate at start with *"Private
directory permissions required"*. Mate now starts there, and says once in its log that who can read
the account files is decided by that folder's own permissions. On an ordinary disk, a data folder open
to everyone is still refused (#401).

**The sunshade as a percent.** The roof tile on the Vehicle page and the sunshade tile on Commands say
how far the sunshade is open; stopped part-way, the Commands tile offers both **Open** and **Close**,
the two positions the car acts on. The Events page lists where it stopped, and Home Assistant gets a
**Sunshade Position** sensor in %. By @arekm (#391).

**A short drive the cloud reads as 0.0 kWh keeps that figure.** Mate took that answer for a miss,
asked again for six hours and left the trip with no energy. When the battery read the same at both
ends, the trip now keeps 0.0 kWh and counts in the averages; on a drive whose battery fell, or was not
read, a zero is still no answer. By @arekm (#394).

**The ⓘ marks open on a tap.** The ⓘ beside the outside temperature on the Overview and beside the
Wallbox's maximum current now open on a tap, in the Home Assistant app too, and a new ⓘ beside
**READY** says what the state means. By @arekm (#399).

**The support bundle says what your account may do with the car**: its rights, and whether the car is
shared with you, beside what the car declares — a command can be refused for either.

### New in 4.10.0

**A day's battery and driving time in Trips.** Open a day in the Trips calendar: its heading now says
how much battery the day's trips used, *84.4% → 51.6% (−32.8%)* from the first trip to the last — or,
when the car charged in between, what the trips used and what the charges added, *−45.3%* and
*⚡ +40.2%* — and how long the day was driven, leaving out reconstructed trips as Statistics does. A
missing reading leaves the battery figure out rather than guessing it. Every figure in a day's heading
and in the month strip says what it is when you point at it or tap it. Each trip's row shows its
battery change, *84.4→51.6% (−32.8%)*, on a phone too, where the trip's times are no longer squeezed
out. By @arekm (#392).

**"Revert to estimate" only where there is one.** On a trip's page the button also appeared on trips
with no estimate kept aside, where it asked for confirmation and then changed nothing. It now appears
only where it can bring an estimate back. By @arekm (#396).

**A charge schedule waits for the car's word.** Saving a charge schedule, or sending a destination to
the navigator, now waits for the car to say it carried it out, for as long as the cloud gives it — on
a B10, 30 s when the car is asleep and 5 s when it is awake. "Schedule saved" means the car took it;
if the car stays silent you see the **amber** notice that it did not confirm in time, and Mate keeps
the times it had. Every command now writes one line in the log: what it sent, with a destination's
address and coordinates left out, and what the cloud answered (#395).

### New in 4.9.2

**An end says its time came after the state before.** On the Events page, "Locked · 4 min" read as a
car locked for four minutes, when those minutes were the time it had been unlocked. It now reads
"Locked · after 4 min". A trip's and a charge's end keep their bare figure, which is the length of the
drive or the charge.

**The row you go back to lands on screen, on a slow phone too.** Back from a trip with the map kept
on, a phone that draws slowly could leave that row below the screen.

**The Events page reads only the days it shows**, and scrolling down a long list no longer composes
it again for every part: each later part now comes at once. On a Raspberry Pi, reading the history at
first start is lighter too, and with a GPS retention set, a trip still open keeps its events as it
keeps its positions.

### New in 4.9.1

**The Events list no longer drifts under you.** Scrolling a long range, the hour and day
headings above you changed height as the browser caught up with them, and what you were reading slid
a few pixels — up to 25 at a time. The hour and day headings now declare the height they will
actually have, so they no longer move what you are reading.

### New in 4.9.0

**One plug-in is one charge.** You plug in at night and unplug in the morning, and the Charges
page showed four sessions. The car is what splits them: it declares the cable gone the instant the
current stops, which is exactly what a wallbox that balances the load, a charger following the sun
or a utility pacing the power looks like from inside the car. The pieces are now put back together
on their own, when the pause is under six minutes and nothing else changed — the same join the
**Join with previous** button performs, with all of its checks. Nothing is rewritten: **Split**
gives the pieces back exactly as the car reported them, and a charge you split is never joined
again. At the first start the nights already in your database come back together too.

**A drive's energy can no longer be twice what its battery lost.** A 7 km drive was drawing
41.4 kWh/100km on the consumption chart, because the cloud's figure for it was 2.90 kWh where the
battery had lost 1.07. Mate already refused a figure past twice the battery, but only when it also
read above 60 kWh/100km. When the charge level fell by a full point or more — a real measurement,
not two or three tenths of rounding — twice the battery is now enough on its own. Trips already
converted go back on the battery estimate at the first start.

**The kilometres measured out of contact say how many of them came back.** Trips that Leapmotor's
own history gives back for a stretch of silence now appear beside that figure, on Statistics and on
the month in the Trips calendar. They are not subtracted from it: those kilometres were covered out
of contact all the same, and the silence still cannot be divided between the end of one drive, a
stop and the start of another.

**The capacity setting says why the official app's kilowatt-hours read higher.** The official app
counts the whole pack, buffer included; Mate counts the usable part. The same energy, measured
against a different 100 %.

### New in 4.8.0

**An Events page lists what the car did, moment by moment.** Locked, unlocked, doors, windows,
cable, climate, READY, trips, charges and the commands you sent — a beginning and an end are two
rows joined by a line in the group's colour, so what went on at the same time, and for how long,
shows at a glance. A map beside the list places each row; filters by word, group and kind live in
the address, so a link or a reload keeps them. The events are derived from the positions Mate
already stores, so on an existing install the first start reads the whole history back, a slice per
poll, and the page says how far it got. With thanks to **@arekm**, who wrote it.

**A trip ends when the car does.** Going to pick someone up — not switching off, just Park and a
wait — used to close the trip after a minute and start a second one when you drove on. The drive
now ends on the reading that shows the car **switched off**: waiting in Park with the car still on
is a stop inside the trip, like a red light. One errand is one trip, and the official consumption
the cloud measures from switch-on to switch-off belongs to it whole.

**A failure Mate put off no longer hides the real one.** Mate keeps a minute between two sign-ins,
and the poll that fell inside it reported "Login temporarily deferred after a recent attempt" —
words about Mate's own timer, which replaced the failure that actually keeps the cloud away.

### New in 4.7.18

**Restoring a backup works on Windows.** On MateDesktop for Windows, restoring a database backup
answered an error, because the file could not be replaced while Mate held it open. The backup now
goes into the live database instead; nothing changes elsewhere.

**A cloud failure says why.** Where the log, the setup page and the diagnostics bundle said only
"Cloud transport failed" or "stage=transport", they now add one word: "dns_failure", "timeout",
"connection_refused", "certificate_rejected" and so on.

**Updating a Docker install:** the manual no longer suggests Watchtower, which has been archived.
Pull the image and recreate the container.

### New in 4.7.17

**The Overview shows the cable while the charger holds it.** A wallbox on a schedule takes the cable and
gives no current until its window opens; the Overview showed no cable then. It now reads the cable from
the car's AC port as well: the tag over the car says "Cable connected (Not charging)", or "(Charge
complete)", and the word under the car says "Parked". By @arekm.

### New in 4.7.16

**A write that finds the database busy no longer stops every write after it.** One write that waited
too long for the database left its transaction open, and from then on every write failed with
"database is locked" until the container was restarted: 17 hours lost on one install. Every poll now
ends such a transaction first, and says so in the log.

**A T03 reads its charge schedule back.** After saving, the Charges page showed "No schedule" because the
T03's configuration carries no plan. Mate now reads it where the earlier library did, only for a car
whose configuration does not say whether the schedule is on or when it starts.

**Report is called Reports**, in the menu and on the page, as every other entry in the menu.

### New in 4.7.15

**A T03 saves its charge schedule again.** Since 4.7.7 the Charges page refused to save a T03's charge
schedule or set its charge limit ("complete current charging configuration is required"). Mate now
fills in what the T03 does not report, as the earlier library did.

### New in 4.7.14

**The chart of a running charge, live.** While the car charges, the Charges page shows the
*📈 Charging data* chart of that charge among the cards at the top, growing with every poll. At home it
draws the wallbox's line beside the car's; a pause with the cable in reads 0 kW. When the readings stop
coming, LIVE gives way to the age of the last one. By @arekm.

**The Monthly Report is now called Report**, in the menu and on the page. Nothing else changes.

### New in 4.7.13

**A T03 takes commands again.** Since 4.7.7 no command reached a T03; with 4.7.12 each one ended in
"signal". Before a command Mate checks the car's last reading, and it looked for a T03's in the wrong
place.

**A missing charge level is not 0%.** *Refresh* stored a reading without a charge level as 0%. It now
stores nothing, as the poller does, and the positions already stored that way are removed once, at the
first start.

### New in 4.7.12

**A T03 shows its readings.** With 4.7.11 a T03 was read again, but Mate showed 0%, 0 km and 0 °C:
the cloud answers a T03 in named fields, and 4.7.11 read them as numbered ones. Now they are read by
name, and the positions stored at 0% are removed once, at the first start.

**Diagnostic bundles leave out coordinates that come by name.** If you posted a bundle taken on a T03
with 4.7.11, it contains your car's position: delete it.

### New in 4.7.11

**A T03 is read again.** Since 4.7.7 a T03 got "No data found" from the cloud at every poll, and Mate
recorded nothing. Mate now asks for a car it has never read as the model the cloud lists it as, and
at the address the earlier library used; the way that answers is kept for that car. Cars that were
read before are read exactly as before.

**Charging data.** Under each charge, *📈 Charging data* opens a chart in bands like a trip's: the
power with the minutes the car said were left, the charge level, and the temperatures — the coldest
cell's and, if switched on, the outside air's.

### New in 4.7.10

**A C10 with range extender shows its charge current and power again.** Since 4.0.0, during an AC
charge of a C10 range extender, Mate discarded the pack current and the power computed from it:
Home Assistant showed *Charge Current* and *Charge Power* as unknown, and each charge's peak power
read 0.0 kW. The car's sensor does measure, and both are back. Charges recorded before this update
keep their 0.0 kW peak: their current was not saved.

### New in 4.7.9

**Earlier months of trips from the Leapmotor cloud.** In **Settings → Cloud trip history**, with
**Import trips from Leapmotor cloud** on, the new menu **Also import earlier months, starting from**
lists the months from September 2026 to last month. Choose once: Mate downloads that month and every
one after it, once each, and the months that end later come in on their own. The line under the menu
says what the choice adds. The Leapmotor cloud holds no single trip before September 2026.

**Battery health opens faster**, and so does a charge's power chart
([#363](https://github.com/ProtossBlaster/leapmotor-mate/pull/363), by @hubcasale): measured on four
months of history, from about 1.4 s to 0.05 s.

### New in 4.7.8

**A new installation starts cleanly.** On a first start, with an empty data folder, Mate's two
processes could open the new database at the same instant and the recording one stopped with
"database is locked". It now waits the few milliseconds the other needs. Existing installations never
met this.

### New in 4.7.7

**Nothing to download to set Mate up.** The Leapmotor app certificate Mate needs to log in — the
same for everyone, it identifies the app, not you — now comes with Mate and is installed by itself on
first start. The setup wizard goes straight to your account: the certificate step and its link are
gone. An installation that already has the certificate keeps it; one uploaded in the old export
format, with attribute lines in front of it, is rewritten as the copy Mate carries — the same
certificate — and the previous files are kept in a backup folder next to the data.

**Mate runs only on its own cloud client.** The client has been Mate's own since 4.0, but an
installation whose first check never finished was still put back on the third-party library Mate
used before. That library and the fallback to it are gone: every installation runs Mate's own
client. One that was still on the old library logs in once with the new client at its first start.
In the diagnostic bundle the `Cloud client` line reads `independent (mate-api)` for everyone.

**A C10 no longer reads 0 km beside a full battery.** As it goes to sleep the C10 sends its range as
0 while the battery is still charged, and the Overview showed "100% · 0 km". Mate no longer takes that
zero for a reading: the Overview keeps the last range the car reported, and Home Assistant keeps its
last value. Below 5% charge a zero still counts, since an empty battery can mean it.

**The cost card counts a merged charge once.** On Statistics, the cost-per-100-km card said a charge
was missing its price when it was one of two rows you had merged. It now counts charges as the
Charges page shows them; the euros and the kWh do not change.

### New in 4.7.6

**A drive now ends when you switch the car off.** Mate declares a drive over once the car has been in
Park for about a minute, and it used to stamp that *whole* minute onto the trip. The end — its time,
charge level, odometer, position and fuel — now comes from the first reading of that stop which shows
the car **switched off**. On one owner's four months of history this moved the end of 183 trips, by 7
to 54 seconds (42 on average). You see it on short drives: a 1 km hop that read 2.9 minutes at
21 km/h now reads 2.2 minutes at 27 km/h. Kilometres, kWh and consumption are unchanged.

If you step out to open a gate and get back in to reverse into the space, the drive stays one drive. A
car left on in Park, or one that does not report whether it is on, keeps the end Mate wrote before.
⚠️ **Drives already recorded do not change** — this applies from this version on.

ℹ️ On a drive of a kilometre or two the cloud sometimes gives its energy as 0.0 kWh, and Mate prefers
the car's own figure to its own estimate. A few very short trips can therefore read `0.00 kWh/100 km`
where they showed an estimate of a few hundredths before.

**The Charges page opens at once.** Opening Charges, or a day in its calendar, used to read the whole
position log for every charge on the page. On a database with 381,076 position rows it went from
**880 ms to 1 ms**, with the same figures on screen.

**A charge you merged can be given its place directly.** Before, you had to separate it, assign the
place and merge it again; now the place applies to the whole group. Merging and unmerging also stop
reloading the whole page and no longer lose the day you were looking at.

### New in 4.7.5

Two changes, both found in one support bundle a user sent.

**Mate now knows the B03X.** The Leapmotor cloud reports a car's *Chinese* project name, so the
crossover sold in Europe as the B03X arrives as `A10` — and Mate had no entry for it. Its battery
therefore fell back to the figure used for a car Mate has never heard of, 65.0 kWh, which the B03X has
never been built with; and the wizard offered no variant, so the first owner to arrive typed a number
by hand. He typed 53.0, which is the figure on the spec sheet — the **nameplate** capacity — while the
field wants the **usable** one, the energy the car actually lets you take out. The wizard now offers
both B03X packs: **39.0 kWh** (nameplate 39.8, 292 km WLTP) and **52.0 kWh** (nameplate 53.0, 382 km).

⚠️ **If you already typed a capacity, Mate leaves it alone** — it never overwrites a number you chose.
A B03X set to 53.0 reads about 2% low on every energy figure; change it to 52.0 in
**Settings → Battery** and it is right from there on.

**The B03 is not the B03X.** They are one character apart and they are two different cars: the B03 is
the hatchback, about 10 cm shorter. It is not in Mate yet, on purpose — it is not on sale and its
battery figures are not published anywhere. Two things the B03X does not have either: a validated
maintenance schedule, and a measured window-opening scale, so its window percentage may be wrong.

**If you send a support bundle, it now says why your installation is still on the older cloud
client** — the state, the reason and when the switch was last attempted. Your account identity is
still never written into a bundle.

### New in 4.7.4

Three changes from a contributor. Two are about Mate asking less; the third is about a signal that,
when the car did not send it, was written down as though the car had answered.

**Mate stops re-asking for the outside temperature when the weather service refuses.** The reading
comes from a free service with a daily allowance. A request that failed left nothing behind, so the
next poll asked again, and so did every poll after it — on a day the allowance ran out that was 432
refusals in under four hours. A failed request now waits twenty minutes, which is exactly how long a
good reading is already trusted; measured over four hours of refused requests, 480 before and 12 now.
If the very first request after a start fails you are without an outside temperature for twenty
minutes; an existing reading is kept as before.

**A READY the car did not send is no longer written down as "off".** READY says whether the car is
switched on, and Mate uses it to tell whether two drives belong to one power-on — which is what
decides when it offers to merge two trips. A frame can arrive without it, and that absence was stored
as a zero. A stop in Park where the car did not say whether it was on used to keep two drives in one
power-on however long it lasted; it now behaves exactly as a switch-off you can see does, and a
couple of seconds in Park to change a driving mode still keeps one drive whole. The status card shows
a dash for a value the car never sent. Nothing changes for a car that reports READY: the whole real
history reconstructs identically.

Also in this release, and invisible from your installation: Mate's own test suite no longer calls out
to the internet. It was asking 187 external addresses on every run, enough that two runs in an hour
used up the hourly allowance GitHub gives an address — and an installation sharing that address then
found its own update check refused.

### New in 4.7.3

Two changes, both from people who use Mate, and one of them corrects something this project got
wrong in public.

**Mate stops asking the cloud to sign in every two hours.** Version 4.4.0 taught it to renew a
session instead of buying a new one with a login, and said that meant about one login a week. It did
not: the renewal was only ever used when the cloud rejected a token mid-request, so an ordinary
session running out still cost a login — measured on a real installation, one every 119 minutes,
twelve a day, while the renewal ticket saved alongside it was good for another week. That cloud
rations logins, and a refused login is a stretch where Mate receives nothing at all: no map, no
duration, no speed. After the fix, on the same installation: six renewals in a row overnight and no
login. Nothing for you to do.

**A charging place can say what kind of charger it is.** Places were built for a second home, so
every place you saved typed its charges as Home — including a charger at work or a free municipal
one. A place now carries its own type (Home, AC, DC, HPC or Free), and the type sets the price as
well as the badge: a place typed AC at 0,45 prices 10 kWh at 4,50, and one typed Free costs nothing
whatever rate was left on it. Places you already have read Home, exactly as before. Assigning a place
to a charge no longer reloads the whole page, so the day you had open in Charges stays open.

### New in 4.7.2

Nine things Mate already knew and did not use.

**Kilometres you drove while Mate could not see the car are kept.** If the odometer has moved while
Mate was out of touch, that jump is the only trace of the drive — and it used to be lost in two
cases: when the reading that came back carried no odometer at all, and when you plugged in the
moment you got home. Both are now rebuilt. Where a charge sits between the two readings the
kilometres are kept without an energy figure, because the battery difference across a charge is not
what the drive spent.

**A reading your car did not send is no longer stored as a zero.** A missing speed and a measured
standstill looked the same in the history; so did a missing odometer and one that had not moved.

**A drive interrupted by a clock change ends where it really ended.** If your machine's clock steps
back mid-drive — an NTP correction, a Raspberry Pi waking up — the trip used to be closed on the
wrong reading, taking its end odometer and SoC from there too.

**A charge your car stops declaring is still drawn.** If your wallbox is turned down mid-session and
your car stops flagging the charge below its detection current, the power chart used to end at that
minute while the charge ran on for hours. The chart, the wallbox comparison, the time-of-use split
and the dynamic-tariff cost now all read the whole session. Your kilowatt-hours and your totals were
never affected.

**Labels no longer land on their values** in languages with longer words — Spanish above all, on the
Summary card.

**An installation left on the old cloud client tries again.** That choice was made once, years of
releases ago, and a check that simply timed out or hit a busy database was kept as though it were an
answer.

**The €/kWh on a charge now says which kilowatt-hours it divides by** — the ones the charger
delivered, or the ones that reached the battery. Both figures were right; only the word was
missing.

**A charge schedule your car would not accept now goes through.** If your car publishes one of
the settings Mate reads and writes straight back with a value Mate did not expect, saving the
schedule — or changing the SoC limit — used to fail entirely. Those settings are your car's, not
Mate's, so whatever it says goes back to it unchanged.

### New in 4.7.1

Nothing new on screen: five places where Mate stopped before the end of what it was doing.

**A dropout never leaves a drive half-recorded.** If Mate loses the cloud mid-drive and the car is
parked or charging when the link comes back within half an hour, the trip now ends there and keeps
the kilometres covered in the gap. After a longer silence it ends at the last thing the car said,
and the kilometres after that are treated like any others covered out of contact. Before, the trip
simply stayed open until the poller restarted, and your next drive opened a second one beside it. Any
trip an earlier version left open is tidied up at the next poll. ⚠️ If you set a **GPS retention**,
the points of a drive still in progress are now kept until it ends, because its end is read from
them.

**The power chart of a charge you merged now draws the whole session.** Turning a wallbox down in
the middle of the night ended the chart at that moment, while the session ran on for hours. The
kilowatt-hours and the cost were always right; only the drawing stopped.

**Two messages say more.** A charge schedule Mate refuses to send now names the setting that is
wrong and what your car published for it, instead of one sentence that fitted three different
settings. And on an installation being upgraded, a harmless collision between Mate's two halves no
longer cuts the rest of the database upgrade short.

**Tapping the logo at the top of the page takes you home**, on the phone as well as on a computer.

### New in 4.7.0

**If you drive a Leapmotor with a range extender, Mate is now for you too.** Those models could only
be read with the BetaTester build; their pages — the REEV page, the petrol per trip and per period,
and the **REEV battery packs in the setup wizard** — are now on the ordinary add-on and the ordinary
Docker image.

**The petrol figure is the car's own.** Leapmotor's history holds, for each drive, how much petrol the
car says it burned, and that is the number the official app shows you. Mate used to work it out
itself, from the tank level at the two ends of the drive, and on the one drive where all three could
be compared it came out **20.7% lower** — 3.886 L against 4.9. The car's figure wins now; the tank
stays as the fallback for a drive Leapmotor has no record of, and each figure says which of the two
you are looking at. ⚠️ **Some old trips will read differently after this update**: Leapmotor's window
is about 28 days, so older drives keep the tank's answer, about a fifth lower.

**A drive that burned nothing says so.** A range extender runs mostly on electricity, and those drives
used to show nothing at all — the same as a drive whose tank Mate could not read. When the car's own
counter reads the same value at both ends of a drive, that is a measurement, and it now reads `0 L`
with *all electric* beside it. The blank is back to meaning only one thing: we do not know.

**Regen is braking again.** On a range extender the generator recharges the battery while you drive,
and Mate was counting that as energy recovered from braking — on the one drive we could measure, 89%
of it was petrol. It no longer counts it. The figure stays hidden on a range extender, as before, but
what is stored is now honest.

**A trip is no longer damaged by a restart.** When Mate restarts in the middle of a drive, that trip
is closed afterwards from what was already recorded. It used to lose its arrival odometer, its
arrival fuel level and its whole regen figure, which read 0.00 kWh — **that last one on fully electric
cars too**. All three are now rebuilt from the readings of the drive itself.

Also: if your database refuses writes — some network shares do — the daily clean-up no longer retries
on every single poll, which was 266 attempts in four hours on the installation that reported it.

### New in 4.6.0

At every poll while you drive, Mate reads the power going out of the battery, the temperature of its
coldest cell, the range estimate and the outside air. It stored all of it and showed you almost none.
Those four readings are now kept **with the trip itself** and put on its page: **Max power** and
**Max regen**, the battery and outside temperature as the lowest-to-highest range of the drive rather
than an average, and — under the duration — how much of it you spent **moving, standing still, and
with no data**, as whole minutes that add up to the duration above them. Beside the average speed
there is now the **median** of the same readings, which on a drive half motorway and half queue says
more than the average does.

The chart under the map is now **Trip data**: one chart in three bands on one time axis — speed and
power, SoC and range, altitude and battery temperature — with one hover box across all of them. Its
legend switches each line on and off, and your choice is remembered in this browser.

The **top speed** is corrected: where Leapmotor's own record of that drive is matched to the trip, the
figure is the car's, not Mate's fastest sample. Mate's readings are about eleven seconds apart, so a
shorter peak was never in them — across 38 drives the sample was below the car's figure on 37.

⚠️ **Trips you drove before this release get those readings once, when Mate starts**, and only from
polls whose position row is still in the database. If you have set a GPS retention, most older trips
will show a dash there: at 7 days about 3% of their points can be filled, at 30 days a fifth, at 90
days seven tenths. With the default setting — keep everything — all of them are. Every trip from now
on has the readings whatever that setting says.

### New in 4.5.5

Two things are removed in this release and none added, both about software updates for the car.
The Overview's "OTA updates" row said **None** whenever your account's message inbox held no
update notice — and it never knew anything about your car: Leapmotor tells the versions only to
the account that owns it, and Mate is meant to run on an account the car is shared with, which
receives no vehicle notices at all. So it said "None" for ever, and under that label "None" reads
as "you are up to date". ⚠️ The **OTA Update Notice** entity in Home Assistant goes with it —
across three owners' diagnostics it found zero notices in 44 successful scans — so if you built an
automation on it, that automation will stop having an entity. Nothing else changes, and nothing is
written to your data.

### New in 4.5.4

Nothing you see changes in this release: it is for us. Since 4.5.3 Mate stores the per-trip
history Leapmotor's own cloud keeps — the same data the official app shows in its per-trip panel —
and every record says how much petrol that drive burned. On a range-extender that is a second,
independent figure beside the one Mate already reads from the car's own tank counter, and it was
sitting in the database with no way to read it out. It now travels in the diagnostics pack, and the
plain diagnostics text says whether that history arrived and whether the fuel field is populated or
flat zero. On a battery-only car it is zero on every drive, which is the correct answer rather than
a silence. Nothing is written to your data and nothing new is asked of the cloud.

### New in 4.5.3

Mate is faster again, and this time the reason is not the questions but the asking. Every read opened
a brand-new connection to the database, which on a small read was most of what it cost; there is now
one per thread. And the battery health estimate was reading every frame of every charge just to find
out that nobody had been sitting in the car with the heater on — that is an indexed check now.
Measured on a real add-on with ninety days of history: Overview 0.213 s → 0.048, Battery 0.129 →
0.012, Charges 0.278 → 0.035, Statistics 0.489 → 0.163, the battery health figure 1.150 → 0.114.
Nothing about what you see has changed.

### New in 4.5.2

Mate is faster, on every page. The slowest pages were asking the database the same question over and over — which time zone to show a time in, once per row; which car you are looking at, eighty-seven times to draw one card; whether the car has been used as a power outlet, by reading a week of data — and every one of those questions opened its own connection to the database. They are asked once now. The Battery page no longer waits for its two long sums: it appears, and the health and standby-drain figures fill in behind it. Measured on a real add-on with ninety days of history: Battery 3.526 s → 0.121 s, Statistics 2.679 → 0.448, Trips 1.696 → 0.406, Settings 1.613 → 0.413. Nothing about what you see has changed.

### New in 4.5.1

Mate loads faster. Deciding which buttons your car may show was reading the database 156 times for every page — once per control, three settings each, each one opening its own connection. It reads them once now. On an add-on running from an SD card that was most of the wait. The Cloud link card in Settings no longer builds itself for every load of the page: it fetches its own figures when you open it. And the menu keeps its place — picking an item from the bottom used to throw it back to the top, so the item you had just used was off screen again.

### New in 4.5.0

The Overview now says whether what it shows can be trusted. Beside the heading there is a small tile: **Mate → cloud → car**, two dots, and a hover (or a tap) on each word tells you the facts behind it — how long the poller has been running, whether the cloud is letting it in and when it last answered, when the car last sent a frame and what it was doing. While everything works, that is all it says. When Mate itself cannot fetch, the tile turns red and says what follows from it: when the last frame arrived, when the next attempt is, the error the cloud gave, and — only when the cloud blamed the password — that the password is the thing to check. Until now a cloud that had been refusing an installation's logins for nine days looked exactly like a car asleep in a garage: "last seen 9 h ago", and nothing else.

Home Assistant hears the same thing. Each car gets a **Data Link** sensor (`sensor.<car>_data_link`) that reads `fresh`, `no_new_data`, `age_unknown`, `login_refused` or `fetch_failed`, with since-when, the error and the next attempt as attributes. It is published even while Mate is waiting out a refused login, and it expires by itself after 21 minutes — so `unavailable` means the poller has stopped, not that the car is quiet. One automation is enough to be told: notify me when it has been neither `fresh` nor `no_new_data` for an hour.

Settings has a new **📡 Cloud link** card: the last 24 hours as a strip of five-minute windows, and seven days of counts — polls, how many carried a current frame, how many failed, how many the cloud refused, and how many logins each part of Mate spent. Every cell and every label explains itself on a hover. The same table now goes into the diagnostics bundle.

Two smaller things. An age past a day is written in days: nine days without contact used to read "216h ago". And Mate's own health check no longer reports a dead process while the cloud is refusing to let it in — it is waiting, and it now says so.

Under a trip's energy, the label that read **getEC** now reads **Measured by the car**: it was the name of a cloud endpoint, not a word for people. **Leapmotor cloud** becomes **Leapmotor history** for the same reason — both figures come from the cloud, and what differs is which one it is: the trip as the cloud's own history records it, or the energy the car itself metered over that window. **Mate estimate** is unchanged.

> This manual is written for people who *use* Mate, not for those who develop it. It explains how to
> set it up from scratch and what every page does. For the internal technical details, see `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## 1. What Mate is (and what it isn't)

**LeapMotor Mate** is an application that you install yourself (self-hosted) and that acts as a
"companion" for your Leapmotor electric car. It connects to the **Leapmotor cloud** (the same one the
official app talks to), reads the car's status and, from that data, reconstructs on its own:

- your **trips** (distance, duration, consumption, regenerative braking recovery);
- your **charges** (energy, power, type, cost);
- the **costs** and the **efficiency** over time;
- the **battery health** and the **maintenance due dates**.

On top of that it lets you **send remote commands** (locking, climate, vehicle preparation,
scheduling…) and, if you like, integrate the data with **Home Assistant** (via MQTT), with
**A Better Routeplanner (ABRP)** and with your **wallbox**.

**What it does NOT do / important limits:**

- **It does not talk to the car directly.** Everything goes through the Leapmotor cloud. When Mate
  "queries" the cloud (polling) it reads the **last known status**: it does *not* wake the car up and
  does *not* drain the battery. It's a safe and inexpensive operation.
- **Battery-electric and range-extender.** The supported models are **T03, B03X, B05, B10, C10**. Their
  **REEV** versions, with a petrol range extender, are supported from **4.7.0**: the REEV page, the
  petrol figures per trip and per period, and the REEV battery packs in the wizard are all on the
  ordinary build. A range extender does **not** get a regen figure — with a generator refilling the
  pack while you drive, charging cannot be told apart from braking — and the electric rate of a
  generator drive stays on the BetaTester build, where it can be watched.
- **European cloud only (Leapmotor International / Stellantis).** Accounts registered on servers of
  other regions (e.g. China) cannot log in. Outside Europe, Mate currently can't be used.
- **It is not an accounting tool.** It estimates cost *from the telemetry*; it does not keep track of
  payment methods, invoices or charging-station subscriptions.

---

## 2. Before you start: the requirements

To set Mate up you need three things:

1. **A Leapmotor account dedicated to Mate.** ⚠️ **Very important.** Create (or set aside) a
   Leapmotor account that you use **only** for Mate. Leapmotor allows only a few simultaneous
   sessions per account: if the same account is also logged in to the official app, to another
   integration or to a second instance of Mate, the clients keep "evicting" each other's session. The
   result is a barrage of *"Invalid token"* / repeated re-logins, the car going **offline** and
   **lost data** (trips and charges not recorded). It's the number-one cause of the problems people
   report. *Solution:* a secondary account with a **password used only in Mate**.

2. **Nothing to download for the app certificate.** Mate needs the Leapmotor app's TLS certificate
   (`app.crt` + `app.key`) to log in — it is **the same for everyone** (it belongs to the app, not to
   your account). It ships with Mate and is installed by itself on first start: you are never asked
   for it.

3. **Email, password and the account's operation PIN.** The **4-digit PIN** is the one you also use
   in the official app to authorize remote commands (locking, climate…).

> 💡 Just want to take a look without setting anything up? Skip it all and use **[demo mode](#9-demo-mode)**:
> Mate starts with a month of realistic fake data, with no car and no account.

---

## 3. Installation

Mate runs the same way in three environments (the interface is identical):

- **As a Home Assistant add-on** — the easiest way if you already have Home Assistant. You add the
  add-on repository, install "LeapMotor Mate" and open it from the HA sidebar (ingress). In this case
  Mate can also read your **wallbox** directly from Home Assistant.
- **As a standalone Docker container** (for example on a NAS) — via `docker-compose`. In this case
  the app is reachable from the browser on **port 4000** (`http://YOUR-SERVER-ADDRESS:4000`).
- **As a desktop application** — [**MateDesktop**](https://github.com/ProtossBlaster/MateDesktop)
  is the same Mate packaged for **macOS and Windows**, for people who run neither Home Assistant nor
  Docker: download it, open it, and you get the same setup wizard. On Windows it is distributed
  **inside a `.zip`** — unpack it first, then run the installer, because a bare `.exe` downloaded
  from the internet has no reputation with SmartScreen yet and gets stopped on the way in. Its web
  server listens only on this computer; use Docker or the add-on for access from another device.

The step-by-step installation instructions (repository, compose, etc.) are in the project's
**README** and on the **Docker Hub** page. Once it's up and running, the *first sign-in* is the same
for both and is described below.

> 📱 **On your phone.** Mate is not a phone app and cannot be one — it has to poll for years, and a
> phone suspends what runs in the background. But you can put it **on your home screen**: open Mate
> in the phone's browser, then *Share → Add to Home Screen* on iPhone, or *⋮ → Add to Home screen*
> on Android. It gets Mate's own icon and opens full screen, without the address bar and toolbar —
> about 110 px of screen back. It stays a shortcut to the server you run: with that off, it opens
> nothing.

> 🔒 **Backup.** All of Mate's data lives in a persistent folder (`/data`): the database, the
> encryption key for the secrets (`secret.key`) and the certificate. If you make a backup, **save the
> database together with its `secret.key`** — without the key, saved passwords and tokens can no
> longer be read. From the Settings page you can download a database backup at any time.
> If you ever restore a database **without** its key, Mate now says so in the log by name — which
> secrets it cannot read and what to do — instead of failing later as a login error. Trips,
> charges and costs are not encrypted and always come back.


**How Mate updates.** A badge **↑ vX.Y.Z** beside the version, top left, means a newer release is on
GitHub (checked every 6 hours). It is a notice, not a button: what you press depends on how you run
Mate.

- **Home Assistant add-on** — nothing to do by hand. Home Assistant offers the update on the add-on
  itself and pressing it is the whole procedure. If the badge has not appeared yet, *Add-on Store →
  ⋮ → Check for updates*. Your data (`/data`) stays where it is.
- **Docker** — pull the new image and recreate the container:

  ```
  docker pull ghcr.io/protossblaster/leapmotor-mate:latest
  docker compose up -d          # or: docker rm -f <container> && docker run … as before
  ```

  The database lives in the volume, not in the image, so nothing is lost.
- **MateDesktop** — nothing to download: the app fetches Mate from the repository **every time it
  starts**, so closing and reopening it *is* the update.

**What changed in v3.14.2 🆕**

- **Trips you could join are drawn once.** The "mergeable" view proposed pairs, so a trip sitting
  between two others appeared twice. A run of trips is now one block with a connector between each
  neighbouring pair — the merge itself is unchanged.
- **A stop inside a joined trip is marked on its chart**, shaded and labelled with its length, so it
  no longer looks like the car losing signal.
- **The note of a joined charge describes the whole session**, not just its first piece.
- **The charge ETA and the "scheduled charge target"** now name what they really are: the target of
  the car's charging PLAN, used only while that plan is switched on. The upper limit you drag in the
  car's own app is not something the cloud reports.
- **Settings warns when the charge-detection floor is above what your car actually draws.** A
  threshold set too high does not record "no charges" — it records half of one.
- **The diagnostics bundle downloads from a phone.** It was a page navigation, which a Home
  Assistant webview drops silently; it is a normal download link now.

**In v3.14.3–3.14.4 🆕** — with two cars, a **command now reaches the car you picked, built the way that car's model expects**. Until these releases the session that talks to the cloud stayed on whichever car the account listed first, so lock, trunk, windows, climate and the charge commands went to that one whatever the picker said — and so did the car's picture and the cloud consumption figures. The model was read from that same car, so on an account holding two **different** models the window position and the climate and A/C-off commands were shaped by the wrong car's rules. One car, or two of the same model: nothing changes.

**In v3.14.5 🆕** — two more places were still answering for the whole install rather than for the car you picked: the **consumption figures** kept in cache (look at one car's Statistics, switch inside half an hour, and you were shown the first one's kilowatt-hours) and the **maintenance start of service**, whose delivery date and odometer were shared between cars — and every service interval is counted from those. With one car, nothing changes.

**In v3.14.6 🆕** — the **Security** row is no longer shown on cars that never report it. The C10 does not send that signal at all (measured on two of them, one over seventeen continuous days), and reading its absence as a zero printed *"Inactive"* — which on a security row reads as *your car is not protected*. A car that does report it, such as the B10, is unchanged.

---

## 4. First start: the setup wizard

On your first sign-in Mate shows a **wizard** (guided procedure). At the top you can choose the
language (🇮🇹 Italiano). Then:

### Step 0 — Choose how to start

Two buttons:

- **▶ Configure my car** — the actual setup (continues below).
- **🧪 Try the demo** — enters demo mode with fake data. You can leave whenever you want.

### Step 1 — Account sign-in

Enter:

- **Leapmotor account email**
- **Password**
- **Operation PIN** (4 digits)

> ⚠️ Here Mate reminds you to use **an account dedicated only to Mate** (see
> [requirements](#2-before-you-start-the-requirements)).

Press **🔍 Detect my car**. Mate checks the credentials and reads the **model and chassis number
(VIN)** from the cloud. If all goes well you see a "Car detected" card showing `Leapmotor <model> ·
VIN ···xxxxxx`.

### Step 2 — Battery

Depending on the model:

- if the European version has **a single battery variant**, Mate sets it on its own — today only the
  T03 (36.0 kWh);
- if there are **several variants** — B10 and B05 (Pro 55.0 kWh / Pro Max 65.0), C10 (RWD 67.0 / AWD
  81.9) — **you choose yours**: the cloud does not say which one is in your car, so Mate cannot know;
- if the detection fails, you can **enter the capacity by hand** (in kWh).

> The capacity shown is the **usable/net** one (the one that really matters for consumption and
> costs) and can always be corrected later, from Settings → Battery.
> Beside it sits the **SoH reference** — the as-new capacity battery health is measured against.
> Mate captures it the first time you save the capacity and then leaves it alone, so that adopting
> a measured (already-aged) figure can never reset your health to ~100 % and hide the ageing. If it
> was captured from the wrong number, health can read above 100 %: correct it in the same place.

> **If Mate's own default has since been disproved 🆕**, Settings → Battery says so on the spot and
> offers the corrected figure with one button — it never rewrites the number behind you. Today this
> is the **C10 RWD**: 69.9 kWh is the nameplate figure, and real charges put the usable pack at 67.0.


### Step 3 — Connect

Press **Connect & Start**. Mate saves the configuration, connects and takes you to the **Overview**.
From this moment the "poller" starts collecting data in the background: the first trips and charges
will appear as you drive and charge.

---

## 5. Getting to know the interface

The interface is made up of:

- **Side menu (sidebar)** — the list of pages (see below). On a small screen it opens with the ☰
  icon.
- **Header** — the page title, any **update available** notice (↑ vX.Y.Z) and the **🔄 Refresh now**
  button.
- **Refresh now button** — forces an immediate read of the car's status without waiting for the
  automatic cycle. Handy after sending a command.
- **"Never set up" strip 🆕** — an orange strip across the top of every page when a car reached
  Mate on its own, without ever going through the wizard: that happens to a **second car** added to
  an install where the sign-in was already done. Until someone answers for it, that car uses the
  **default battery pack of its model**, which bends its kWh, its price per kWh and its consumption.
  The button opens the wizard, where the pack and the PIN are chosen.


At the bottom of the menu you'll find **⚙️ Settings**, and **🚪 Log out** *only if you have set an
access password* — that one ends the password session, nothing else. It is not there otherwise, and
there is nothing to end.

**To change the car's PIN 🆕** — if you change it on the car, nothing needs unlinking: go to
**Settings → Vehicle**, and under the account address you will find **Operation PIN**. It is typed
twice, with an eye to read it back, and takes effect at once — both for commands from the page and
for the ones arriving from Home Assistant. Asked for by **@alextchao** (#225).

**If two Leapmotors share your account 🆕** — a **car picker** appears in the header, next to the
model badge. It is there only from the second car onwards: with one Leapmotor nothing changes at
all. Pick a car and everything follows it — the Overview, Statistics, trips, charges, the
reports, the commands that car allows and its Home Assistant entities. Your choice is remembered. On a phone the picker is inside the ☰ menu, under the heading.

Settings stay shared, because they rarely differ under one roof: prices, currency, time zone, home
location. What belongs to the car stays with the car — its battery capacity, its **operation PIN**, its **A Better Route Planner token**,
whether it is a range-extender, what it can be commanded to do and which sensors it actually has.
Both cars are handled by **one Mate**: one poller, one database, one session against the Leapmotor
cloud, instead of two installs signing each other out.

**To unlink the Leapmotor account** — a different thing entirely — go to **Settings → Vehicle →
🔓 Log out**. That clears the saved credentials and reopens the setup wizard; your certificate,
trips and charges stay (@JoseRMorales, #223, who went looking for the first one and wanted the
second).

Many pages **refresh themselves** roughly every 30 seconds, so the "live" values (status, charge in
progress…) stay fresh without reloading the page.

A calendar keeps the month you are looking at in the page's address, so a reload — the page's own or
yours — brings that month back with the day or range you had open; **Jump to today** returns to the
current month.

**Language, currency and units** are changed from *Settings → 🌍 Language & Currency*:

- **Language:** English, Italiano, Français, Deutsch, Polski, Nederlands, Português, Español.
  *(A written manual like this one exists in English, Italian, French, German and Spanish.)*
- **Currency:** for costs (€, £, …).
- **Units:** metric (km, °C) or imperial UK/US (miles, °F). The data is always stored in km/°C; only
  the way it's **displayed** changes.

---

## 6. The pages, one by one

The order below is the same as in the side menu.

### Overview
**(menu: Overview)** — The home. At the top there's a **main card** with the car's image and its live
status:

- **state of charge (SoC)** and estimated range;
- **status icons** that change colour: lock (green = locked, amber = unlocked), trunk (red if open),
  windows (purple if open), climate, etc.;
- **quick commands** (lock/unlock, find car…), already "aware" of the current state;
- when the car is **charging**, an **animation** shows the energy flow and a tag with the estimated
  time "to X%" (X = the charge limit you set in the car);
- a **"Cable connected (Not charging / Charge complete)"** tag when the cable is plugged in but it isn't actively
  charging. Beside it, if you have set a **scheduled charge**, the car's own window appears (for
  example **"Charge 01:50 – 12:00"**) — the answer to "the cable is in, so why isn't it charging?".

When the car is **powering an external device through the V2L (vehicle-to-load) adapter**, the
Overview shows a **V2L block** with the **status** (Active / Inactive), the **instantaneous power** in
watts — reported **net of the car's own ~300 W overhead**, so it matches what your device actually
draws — with a 0–3500 W bar, and the **energy drawn this session**. It refreshes about every **10 s**
while a session is running. It is **read-only**: V2L is started **on the car** (gear in Park + a device
connected), not from Mate. It is accurate from about **42 W** upward (the car's own current-sensor
resolution — a tiny ~10 W load stays invisible).

Further down you'll find mini-statistics and a **"Car responsiveness" indicator** (a 🟢/🟡/🔴 dot, ⚪
if there's no data): it summarizes how well the car has responded to the latest commands sent.

**The last charge says both 🆕** — the **Last charge** tile leads with the same figure as the charge's
row in Charges: at home, with a wallbox counter, the **🔌 wallbox (billed)** kWh, and under it what reached the
pack — *🔋 12.0 kWh in battery (DC) · efficiency 81%*; elsewhere the battery figure, with the charger's
own kWh on a line of its own where you typed it. The cost under it is the cost of the number above
it. It used to show the battery figure alone, beside a cost computed on the other one.

**The range at your charge limit, and at 100% 🆕** — under the estimated range Mate shows how far the
car would go **at the limit you actually charge to** (80%, say), with the figure at 100% beside it.
When the car reports no limit below 100 there is a single line, so the same number is never printed
twice.

**The outside temperature, from the weather 🆕** — the Leapmotor cloud sends the cabin temperature but
never the air outside, and neither does the official app. With the switch on, while the car is awake
Mate looks its position up against [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com) — at most once every 20
minutes or 10 km, whichever comes first — and shows the reading next to the cabin one. It is **off by
default**, because the lookup sends the car's position to Open-Meteo: the single opt-in is in
*Settings → trip defaults*. The same reading becomes an **Outside Temp** entity in Home Assistant and
gives each trip readings along the way, for its highest and lowest temperature.

#### The three temperatures: cabin, A/C target, battery
Not every Leapmotor sends all three. Mate tells **three different situations** apart, because
confusing them produces absurd numbers:

- **the sensor exists but this update didn't carry it** → the row stays and shows **"—"**;
- **zero is a real reading** (a battery pack genuinely at 0 °C, in winter) → Mate prints **0 °C**,
  because that is the reading that matters most;
- **the car never sends that sensor at all** → the row is **not shown**, and the matching Home
  Assistant entity is **removed**.

The last case is **measured, not inferred from the model**: Mate only says it after roughly half an
hour of updates in which that value never once arrived — so a fresh install shows every row, and if a
sensor starts answering the row (and the entity) **comes back on its own** within a few hours.

If you use the temperature condition in **Prepare vehicle** ("only pre-cool above 25 °C"), an
**unknown** temperature does not fire the preparation, and says so in the log. It used to count as
0 °C, so on a car without a cabin sensor the "below 5 °C" condition was satisfied on **every update,
all year round**.

### Trips
**(menu: Trips)** — The list of your drives, one per drive. For each trip you see **distance,
duration, consumption (kWh/100 km), energy recovered** in braking and the estimated **cost**.

- Clicking a trip opens the **detail**, with the **GPS track** on a map and the data of that single
  trip.
- **A calendar, and a search.** Trips are browsed by **month**; click a day to see just that day's
  drives, or use the **search** with a date range, a distance or an efficiency window to pull out a
  set across the whole history. An open day's heading says how much battery its trips used:
  *84.4% → 51.6% (−32.8%)*, or, when the car charged between them, *−45.3%* used and *⚡ +40.2%* charged,
  and how long the day was driven. On a phone each trip's row gives its battery too, *84.4→51.6% (−32.8%)*,
  under the duration.
  Shift-click, a mouse drag or, on a phone, holding a day opens **several days at once**: one heading
  for the range, then each day under its own.
- **Merging, from the day you are looking at.** A stop long enough to end a drive can split one
  journey into two rows. Open a day and the **🔗** button beside its date offers that day's joinable
  pairs: a slider widens what counts as one stop, you preview the combined route before committing,
  and it is **reversible** at any time (Unmerge). You can also **delete** a trip.
- Short stops (traffic lights, queues) do **not** split a trip: one drive stays a single row.
- **A trip abandoned by the cloud ends when the car last spoke.** If the link drops while you are
  driving, Mate closes the trip by itself after half an hour — but dates it at the **last real
  news**, not at the moment it noticed. So the duration holds no half hour of silence and the
  average speed stays honest.
- **A dropout never leaves a trip open.** If Mate loses the cloud mid-drive and the car is still
  driving when the link returns within half an hour, the trip simply carries on. If the car is by
  then parked or charging, the trip ends there, and the kilometres covered in the gap are part of
  it. After a longer silence the trip ends at the last thing the car said before it, and the
  kilometres after that are treated like any others covered out of contact.
- **A trip ends when the car does 🆕.** A drive closes on the reading that shows the car **switched
  off**, and that reading gives it its end: time, charge level, odometer, position and fuel. So
  **waiting in Park with the car still on is a stop inside the trip**, not its end — going to pick
  someone up and driving back is one trip, not two, and the official consumption the cloud measures
  from switch-on to switch-off then belongs to that one trip whole, with no halves to merge. It is
  the first reading that *saw* the car off, so after a gap in the link it comes later than the
  switch-off itself. A car that does not report whether it is on closes after about a minute in
  Park, as before, and so does one whose Park reading is a frame the cloud has been repeating for
  half an hour. The end stays at the last reading when the switch-off reading lacks something, or
  when a later one shows another odometer. A trip Mate finds still open when it restarts, with the
  car already parked, is closed on its last recorded point; one standing in Park for half a day on a
  car that keeps reporting itself on is closed where it stopped moving.
- **Kilometres Mate did not see are not added to the trips around them.** When the link to the cloud
  drops for longer than a short gap inside one drive (see above), the car keeps moving but Mate
  cannot see it; when the link returns, all it finds is an odometer further along. That jump can
  hold the end of one drive, a stop, and the beginning of another, and **nothing says how it
  divides**. If the car is found parked, its charge level has not gone up and no charging was
  detected over that interval, Mate rebuilds one trip from the jump alone, without a route.
  Otherwise (a new drive already under way, a charge, or a charge level that rose) Mate attributes
  the kilometres to nobody. A line above the calendar states that month's kilometres, charge and
  cost, and the **Statistics** page states the running total: *measured, but not attributable to a
  specific trip — therefore left out of distances, consumption and costs.*
  ⚠️ This is why Mate's own total can sit below the car's odometer: the difference is that line.
- **Elevation and outside temperature.** The Leapmotor cloud reports neither, so a few minutes after
  a drive ends Mate looks the trip's GPS track up against [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com)
  (free, no key, no account). The detail then gains an **altitude line in the Trip data chart**, the
  metres **climbed and descended** (the *Ascent / descent* row; its ⓘ says how they are counted),
  and the **highest and lowest** temperature of the drive — not an average, so a valley-to-pass
  climb shows the real drop. Between them they explain a good part of a drive's consumption: a climb
  costs energy, cold costs range. Trips recorded before this existed have a **Calculate elevation**
  button, and the whole thing can be switched off in Settings.
- **Driving and stopped 🆕.** Under the duration, the detail splits it into the time driving and the
  time stopped — at a standstill inside the drive (lights, queues) — from Mate's readings several
  seconds apart. A stop between joined pieces counts as neither, and a hole in the readings shows as
  *no data* instead of being given to either.
- **Median speed 🆕.** Under the average speed, the detail gives the median of the same readings,
  those while moving: the speed half of them stayed below. A short fast stretch lifts the average of
  a town drive, while the median keeps its usual pace.
- **Max speed from the car 🆕.** When the car's cloud record of a drive is matched to the trip (the
  same record that gives the official consumption), the detail shows the top speed the car itself
  measured. Mate's own readings are several seconds apart and miss short peaks — on a B10 by up to
  21 km/h — so a trip without that record keeps the sampled figure, marked with an ⓘ.
- **Max power and max regen 🆕.** The detail names the highest power the battery gave out and the
  highest flowing back into it while braking, from the pack's voltage and current Mate reads at
  every update. The readings are several seconds apart, so a short peak between two of them is
  missed: the figures are a floor, and the ⓘ beside them says so. Not shown on a range extender,
  like the regen figure.
- **Battery temperature 🆕.** The car reports one battery temperature — its coldest cell's, in whole
  degrees — and the detail gives its readings during the drive as one range, lowest to highest, such
  as 19 – 22 °C; the ⓘ beside the row says it is the coldest cell. In winter the range shows how cold
  the pack was and how far the drive warmed it up.
- **Trip data chart 🆕.** The chart under the map is called *Trip data* and is split into bands that
  share one time axis, one cursor line and one hover box, its lines grouped by band: **driving**
  (speed, and the battery power — above zero out of the battery, below zero back into it),
  **battery** (SoC and the car's range estimate) and **altitude with the battery temperature** (the
  coldest cell's). A band has at most two scales, one on each side, each with its unit at the top
  and its numbers in its line's colour. Each entry of the legend switches its line on and off — an
  empty square marks a line switched off — and a band whose lines are all off folds away. All lines
  start switched on; the choice is remembered in the browser for every trip. The hover box opens
  with the time of day, to the second, and the minute of the drive.
- **Official consumption from the cloud 🆕** — when available, a trip's **consumption, efficiency and
  cost** come from Leapmotor's **official figure** (the real **driving / A·C / other** split) instead of
  the battery‑% estimate alone. Right after a drive you see the estimate marked **⏳ provisional**; once
  the cloud has processed the data (usually some tens of minutes) it is **replaced on its own** with the
  official one and the **breakdown** appears in the detail. Older trips have a **"Convert with official
  data"** button. If the cloud doesn't have a trip's data (it happens, on any connected car), the
  **estimate** stays — not an error. **Always on**, no setup.
  - **Counted from when the car is switched ON, not from the drive 🆕** — the official figure covers the
    whole **power-on session** (from switch-on to switch-off), so it can include time the car was on
    before you started driving. If you **never switch the car off between two trips** (you stop, stay in
    Park, drive again), the cloud counts them as **one** session — Mate tells you to **merge the two
    trips** to get the real combined consumption. Mate only says so when the car reported it: a stop
    in Park of more than a minute during which the car did not say whether it was on is not counted as
    one session.
- **Where a trip started and ended 🆕** — a trip's row reads **"A → B"**, and the *Trip summary* on its
  page names both ends. An end inside one of your **charging places** shows the place's name with
  "(charging place)", so renaming the place renames those trips; elsewhere it is the address (a shop or a
  station by its name, else the street and number, then the town). Mate looks it up shortly after a trip
  ends, with the provider set in *Settings → Address lookup*, where a switch turns it off. A missing
  address, on an older trip for instance, is looked up at once by 🧭 in the *Trip summary*. The search box
  finds a trip by either end. Mate no longer writes addresses into the trip's note, which stays yours;
  notes it wrote before stay as they are.
- **Your note + driving tags 🆕** (#107) — in a trip's detail you can jot a **free-text note** (traffic,
  weather, road type, any remark) and tag the **drive mode** (Comfort / Normal / Sport) and **One-Pedal**
  (on/off) you used. Mate can't read these from the car — Leapmotor doesn't send them to the cloud — so
  you set them by hand; they help explain why two otherwise similar drives consumed differently.

- **A searched period adds itself up 🆕** — the date filters could always select any window, but the
  results listed their cards and totalled nothing, so a billing period that is not a calendar month
  had to be added up by hand. Above the results you now get that period's own **trips, km and cost**
  — the same figures, from the same source, as the calendar's month strip.

### Map
**(menu: Map)** — Everywhere you have driven, on one map. The car's current position is there (if the
latest data from the cloud has no valid GPS fix, Mate **keeps the last valid position** rather than
making the map disappear), and with it:

- **Every trip's route**, drawn as a connected line rather than loose dots, never joined across two
  different trips.
- **A dashed magenta bridge where the signal was lost.** A tunnel, a dead zone, a hiccup at the
  cloud — when the gap between two recorded points is much larger than that trip's own sampling
  rhythm, Mate draws the join **dashed** instead of solid. A solid line means *the car really drove
  this*; a dashed one means *we lost it here* and the straight line between the ends is not a road.
- **Frequent places**, as bubbles sized by how often you stop there, and **charging stations** you
  have used.
- **"Trips shown"**, a box on the legend row. A long history leaves the map a solid mass of
  overlapping lines, so you can cap it to the N most recently driven trips; **0 means all of them**,
  which is how it starts. Capping also makes each drawn route hug the real road more closely,
  because the drawing budget is spread over fewer trips.

### Charges
**(menu: Charges)** — The list of charges. For each one: **energy added (kWh)**, **peak power**,
**type** and **cost**, with the **effective €/kWh** clearly visible.

- **A charge is a row 🆕** — the list reads like the Trips one, with a thumbnail of the curve on each row:
  the power (kW) above the state of charge (%). Click a row to open the rest under it: the energy in
  detail, the chart, your note and the actions. The type, 🆓, ✎ and 📍 are edited on the row itself.
  **Expand all**, in the heading of a day, a range or a search, opens every row, and **Collapse all**
  closes them.

The type is classified with a label:


- **The "to confirm" banner takes you there 🆕** (#240) — when a charge has ended without a type,
  a strip appears at the top of the page. **Click it**: it opens the charge on its own day of the
  calendar and marks it, instead of leaving you to work out which day it is on.
- **When a part of the page can't load 🆕** — several blocks in Mate fill themselves in a moment
  after the page opens. If one of them fails, it now **says so under itself**, with the error and a
  **Try again**, rather than leaving an empty space with no explanation.
- **Home** (your wallbox **or a domestic socket**), **AC** (public alternating current), **Fast/DC**,
  **HPC** (ultra-fast charging) and **Free**; at the bottom of the menu, **✎ Manual** for the total
  you paid (see below). A charge nobody has confirmed yet reads **❓ To confirm** until someone
  picks one.
- **Home does not mean wallbox.** *Home* is where you charged, not what you charged from — a
  three-pin socket in the garage is a Home charge too. It matters because of what gets billed: with a
  wallbox meter mapped (see *Wallbox* below), the charge is billed on the **energy the meter
  delivered**; without one, it is billed on the **energy that reached the battery**, exactly like a
  public charge. Between the two there is the charger's own loss as heat, typically 10–15 %.
- **✎ Manual — the total you paid** — for public charging points with complicated tariffs
  (subscriptions, session fees…) you **write in the total you actually paid by hand**: open the
  type menu, type it in the **✎ Manual** row at the bottom, then **OK** (the **✎** beside the badge
  is the same box). It overrides the automatic estimate and **leaves the charge's type alone**: a
  charge with no type then reads **✎ Manual** and is no longer waiting to be confirmed, and a
  charge with a type keeps it. The cost on the row carries a small **billed** tag instead of
  **est.**, and *Reset*, in the ✎, brings the computed figure back. The charges you priced this way
  before v3.16.0 read **✎ Manual** again, with their price: there is nothing to do.
- **Home vs Public 🆕** — beside the *AC vs DC Distribution* card there is a second one:
  **Home**, **Public**, **✎ Manual** and **To confirm**, as a donut and a tile each (the last two
  only when there are any). They always add up to the number of charges written above them, so a
  charge priced by hand is not counted as public, and one still waiting for its type shows as
  waiting.
- **A charge abandoned by the cloud ends when current last flowed 🆕** (#289) — when the car falls
  asleep with the cable in, the cloud does not say so: it keeps repeating the last news it has, and
  in that news the cable still reads connected. The charge used to stay open until the car next woke
  up — four hours booked as nineteen, and nothing in the list until it closed. After half an hour
  with no fresh news Mate now closes it by itself and dates it at the **last reading with real
  current**: the duration no longer holds the night of silence. A wallbox pause is untouched —
  there the car is awake and the news keeps coming.
- **The charger's own kWh 🆕** (#222) — on a public charger Mate **has no meter**: it reads only what
  went into the battery, while the charger bills you for what came out of its own. You can type that
  figure in: in the charge's opened row, under the energy, there is a **✎**; the box **opens only if you
  open it** and is **always empty** — so a stray click changes nothing, and pressing OK on an empty
  box leaves everything as it was. *Remove* takes a wrong number back. From then on it **prices the
  charge**, exactly as a wallbox counter does at home, and shows the **efficiency** (how much the
  on-board charger turned into heat). The energy Mate reports stays the one **measured at the
  battery**. On a **joined charge** the figure you type covers the pieces it was typed for — a session
  joined to it later counts on its own — and when the pieces bill on different figures (the wallbox
  caught one piece and not the other, or you typed the figure on one piece before joining) the row
  and the Overview lead with the sum, under the word *delivered*, and the €/kWh divides by it 🆕.
  Efficiency and loss beside the typed readings are shown only when those readings cover every
  piece of the joined charge. A partial wallbox reading still lets you view and correct the solar
  energy you entered.
- **What is counted, and what is not 🆕** — a charge appears in these comparisons only when it has
  **both** figures, the meter's and the battery's. A session with only one of them would push the
  ratio above 100 %, which no charger can do. **Charges still in progress are left out**: a session
  that is still arriving has no total to compare yet, and joins the totals when it ends.
- **The month says both 🆕** — above the calendar: *"154.93 kWh delivered · 142.57 in battery"*. The
  first is what came out of the meters (the wallbox, or the kWh you typed); the second is what
  reached the pack. Between them sits the conversion loss you pay for.
- **The totals say both too 🆕** — the **Total energy** tile at the top of the page, and **Energy
  Charged** on the Statistics page, are the same *delivered* figure, with *in battery* under it when
  the two differ. One rule for every total: the wallbox counter where there is one, the charger's
  own kWh where you typed it, otherwise the battery figure.
- Charges that happened while the car was off/offline are **reconstructed** too, from the jump in the
  state of charge.
- **Your note 🆕** (#107) — each charge has a **free-text note** (in the opened row, under the chart) for
  the things the numbers don't capture: where the station was, shade/shelter, how reliable it is, parking
  conditions, weather, any personal remark. *📝 Add a note*, or ✏️ beside a note, opens the field.
- **Where a charge happened 🆕** — beside 📍 a charge shows the station and its address, or else your
  **charging place** there or the address, looked up as for trips. A missing address, on an older charge
  for instance, is looked up at once by 🧭 beside 📍. The search box finds a charge by them, and the
  charges export lists them. Mate no longer writes into the charge's note, which stays yours; notes it
  wrote before stay as they are.
- **The odometer of the charge 🆕** (#237) — every session now carries **what the odometer read when
  it started**. Mate writes it on everything it sees, and recovered it once from the charges already
  in the archive. On a charge **you type in** there is an *Odometer* box: it is the only way a
  session from before Mate existed can carry kilometres at all — nothing from those days can supply
  them. Typed in **your** unit (km or miles).
- **How far the car went between two charges 🆕** (#237) — on the row, after AC/DC: *🛣 122 km*, from the
  car's own odometer. It appears only where **both** charges carry a reading and only where the car
  actually moved: two sessions the same afternoon say nothing rather than print a zero.
- **Import charges from a spreadsheet (CSV)** — *Import charges from CSV* hands you a
  **self-documenting template**; fill it in with Excel or Numbers and upload it back. Only two
  columns are required, the date and the energy; the rest — cost, AC/DC, start/end percentages, end
  time and the **odometer 🆕** — are optional. The charges **export** can be re-imported as it
  stands. **Re-importing the same file no longer creates duplicates 🆕** (#237): a line matching a
  session already recorded **completes** it (writing the odometer) instead of adding a second copy,
  and Mate tells you how many it added and how many it completed. It used to double everything in
  silence. ⚠️ On a session already recorded **only** the odometer is written: a cost Mate worked out
  from a real charging curve is never overwritten.

- **Several days at once 🆕** — the calendar opens a range of days the way the Trips one does
  (Shift-click, a drag across the days or, on a phone, holding a day): one heading with the range's
  sessions, kWh and cost, then each day under its own. An open day's heading carries the same totals.
- **A searched period adds itself up 🆕** — above the results, that window's own **sessions, kWh
  delivered (with the battery figure beside it) and cost**. Electricity billed from the 22nd to the
  21st, or any other period that is not a calendar month, no longer has to be added up by hand.

- **Charging data chart 🆕** — in the opened row, one chart in bands on the session's time axis, like
  a trip's: **charging** (the car's DC power, the wallbox's AC power
  beside it on a home charge with a mapped wallbox, and how many minutes the car said were left),
  **battery** (SoC) and **temperatures** (the coldest cell's and, when
  the outside temperature is switched on in Settings, the outside air at the car's spot). Each entry
  of the legend switches its line on and off, a band with every line off folds away, the choice is
  remembered in the browser, and the hover box opens with the time of day and the time since the
  first reading. The AC-vs-DC comparison on the Wallbox page is this same chart.
  While a charge runs, the same chart sits with the cards at the top of the page, live, the
  wallbox's line beside the car's when the charge is at home: it says when the charge began and from
  which level, and grows with every poll.

### Charge Prices
**(menu: Charge Prices)** — Here you set **how much you pay for energy**, so Mate can calculate the
costs. You can define a price **for each type** of charge (Home, AC, Fast, HPC) and choose between:

- **Fixed rate** (a single €/kWh);
- **Time-of-use bands (TOU)** — different prices for the day of the week and the time band (e.g.
  F1/F2/F3, cheaper at night).
- **Dynamic (Home Assistant sensor) 🆕** — Mate reads the price from an entity that **changes over
  time** (Nordpool, Tibber, your utility's own integration) and weighs it across the session's own
  power curve, so a charge that ran across a price change is billed at what each part of it really
  cost.
- **Custom kWh (Home Assistant) 🆕** — for when the price is fixed but **how much of the charge you
  paid for** is not. With solar on the roof only part of a session comes off the grid, and nothing
  in the car or in the cloud knows the split — a Home Assistant helper does. Pick the entity that
  holds the kWh this charge should be billed for; when the charge ends Mate reads it and multiplies
  it by your fixed price. **The energy Mate reports for the charge does not change** — that stays
  what reached the battery; only the money is worked out from your figure. If the entity is missing
  or says nothing, the charge falls back to the fixed price over the measured kWh.

- **Solar kWh (manual) 🆕** — the same case as above, without Home Assistant. Choose it if you have
  solar and would rather type, charge by charge, how many kWh came off your own roof: Mate subtracts
  them from what the wallbox measured and bills you only the rest. A **☀️ Solar** field appears on
  the charge's opened row, under the energy, and the line beside it spells the sum out — "20.0 delivered −
  8.0 solar = 12.0 paid" — so a number typed the wrong way round shows itself at once. A figure
  larger than the wallbox measured is refused. It is offered only on home charges the wallbox
  actually measured: without that reading there is nothing to subtract from, and a line says so.
  **The energy Mate reports does not change** — it stays the measured one; your figure only makes
  the cost.

> The last three are for **Home** charges only: a public session is billed by its operator, and a
> helper of yours has no business pricing it.

The **Home** price is the one that feeds the cost of home charges and, in turn, the cost of trips
(calculated on the "average" price of the energy in the battery at the time of the trip).

> Price changes apply **only to future charges**: costs already calculated do not change. With
> time-of-use bands you can also choose *how* to split a session across the bands — *Accurate split*
> (on the real power curve) or *By start time* (the whole session at the band it started in).

> **No ceiling on the price 🆕** — the fields used to refuse anything above `9.99`, which only ever
> suited euro- or dollar-scale tariffs. Iceland, Japan, Korea and Hungary price electricity in tens
> or hundreds of currency units per kWh: type the figure exactly as it is. The **Icelandic króna**
> is in the currency list, and every amount now shows **at least two decimals**, so nothing is
> rounded on screen.

### Statistics
**(menu: Statistics)** — Your averages and totals over time: **distance of recorded trips** 🆕 (it
used to read *total distance*, but it has always been the sum of the finished trips — not the car's
odometer) and number of trips,
**average distance per trip**, **drive time**, **average consumption** (weighted by distance) and
**best**, **energy used and charged** (the energy charged is what the chargers **delivered**, with the **in battery** figure under it — the same pair the Charges page shows 🆕), total and average **regen**, number of **charge sessions**,
with the related **trends** (efficiency and regen over time). The totals also include a **Total V2L**
card showing the cumulative energy drawn via V2L over all time.

**Consumption against outside temperature 🆕** — one dot per finished trip: its consumption against
the air temperature it was driven in, with a dashed trend line through them. It answers the question
every owner asks when the cold arrives — *how much does my car really drink at 5 °C?* — out of your
own driving rather than a table. It needs the trips to carry an outside temperature (see *Overview*),
and on realistic data the pattern is legible after about a month of driving.

**Cost per 100 km 🆕** — what covering 100 km actually costs: **the euros spent**, divided by **the
kilometres driven**. No price per kWh and no estimate — the sum of what you paid over the sum of
what you drove, so it includes the kWh that moved the car nowhere (climate, preconditioning, the
charger's own losses).

**The euros and the kilometres are from the same period 🆕** (#237) — a charge that ended **before**
the first recorded trip has no kilometres of its own to be divided by, and does not enter the
figure. Anyone who had typed in a year of old charges was seeing months of spending divided by one
afternoon's kilometres: the number came out tens of times too high. A charge made **after** the last
trip does keep its money — those kilometres arrive tomorrow.

**And it can divide by the car's own odometer 🆕** (#237) — if your charges carry an odometer (see
*Charges*), Mate measures the distance between the first and the last with the car's own counter
instead of the reconstructed trips: brim to brim, the way fuel has always been measured. **It works
even with no recorded trips at all**, which is the case for anyone who kept a notebook and installs
Mate months later. Mate picks whichever basis prices **more of what you actually spent** and says
which one under the figure — *"over the 18422 km on the car's odometer"* rather than *"over the km
recorded"*. On an ordinary history the trips win and nothing changes. On a range-extender the petrol is added beside the electricity — the petrol **burned**, priced at what the tank cost you, not the whole refuel: a tank you have paid for is mostly still in the tank, and charging it to the kilometres it has not driven yet made the figure several times too high 🆕. If any charge
has no price the card says so, because the real figure is then higher. It follows your units: with
miles it becomes "per 100 mi".

Beside the money the card now also shows **how many kWh those 100 km took**, labelled *"including
standing time" 🆕*. It is worked out as a balance, not as a sum of journeys: the energy charged
inside the window, minus whatever was still in the battery at the end that was not there at the
start. So it covers everything that left the pack — driving, climate, preconditioning, the
charger's own losses — which is why it is **higher than the consumption in the Trips header**, and
why the label says so. If a charge in that window has no energy figure the card says that too: the
number is then a floor, not the whole story.

**How far back these numbers go 🆕** — a line at the top of the page is a reminder that **every**
total on Statistics is what Mate has recorded since it was installed, with the date it starts from,
and **not** the car's own odometer total.

**What each figure covers 🆕** — *Avg consumption* is the mean over the kilometres that **have** a
consumption figure, and *"over 452 km of 509 km"* appears underneath when those are fewer than the total — it names both
numbers, so you can see at a glance whether the figure covers most of the window or a corner of it.
*Energy used* adds up only the trips whose energy Mate knows: a trip without one is **left out**
rather than counted as zero, and the tile says how many trips it speaks for. On a car where every
trip carries its own consumption — which is nearly always — none of this shows at all.

### Events
**(menu: Events)** — What the car did, moment by moment: unlocked and locked again, a door or the
tailgate opened and closed, the cable in and out, the climate on and off, READY on and off, where the sunshade stopped, every trip
and charge from its start to its end, and every command sent from Mate. The list opens on the last
three days, newest first, in one card with a heading per day and a thin line per hour; a row's dot has
the colour of its group's pill. The buttons above the pills reach further back — 3, 7 or 30 days, 3, 6
or 12 months, or All — counted back from today; dates typed under ⚙ win over them. A long range comes
in parts of a thousand rows, the next one loaded as the end of the list comes into view.

- **A beginning and an end are two rows, joined by a line.** Left of the times, a line in the group's
  colour joins an end's dot to its beginning's, as in a graph of git history, so what went on at the same
  time, and for how long, shows at a glance. The end says how long the state lasted — "Tailgate closed ·
  after 35s" — and a click on the line or a dot lights the pair and its two rows without scrolling the list.
  When the beginning is before the days shown, the line runs faded off the bottom of the list and the end
  names it: "from 02 Oct 2026 14:20:05". A state still going runs its line to the top and says **(in progress)** only when the car's last frame is fresh; while the cloud repeats an old frame (the car asleep, or
  out of coverage) the row names the time of that frame instead.
- **The sunshade is one row where it stopped** — "Sunshade 50% open", "Sunshade closed" — with no line and no
  "after": it stays open for days, and a line would only cross the whole page. A level seen in one frame
  only is not listed: the sunshade moving past it, or a stop shorter than the time between two frames.
- **Times are the car's, to the second**: the time of the first frame that showed the new state,
  confirmed by the next one. Holding the pointer over a time shows it beside the time Mate recorded the
  row. Trips, charges and commands have only Mate's clock, so beside a signal from the same few seconds
  their order can differ by those seconds.
- **An end answers its own question.** READY off: how far the car went and the charge level before and
  after. Climate on: parked or during a trip, the target and the outside temperature; Climate off: the
  cabin before and after. Cable disconnected: the energy charged and, when the first charge began more
  than five minutes after the cable went in (a wallbox waiting for its schedule), how long it waited.
  The end of a trip or a charge carries the figures of Trips and Charges.
  These figures stand out from the rest of the row; a cost is green, the delay before charging amber.
- **Places**: a row at one of your charging places (*Charge Prices → Charging places*) names it; a trip's
  start or end elsewhere is named by its address, as in Trips, and a charge as on its row in Charges.
- **The map** is hidden until **🗺 Show map** above the list shows it (beside the list on a wide screen,
  above it on a phone or a narrower one), and next time it is as you left it. Every row with a position
  has a 🌍: it shows the map if needed, lights the row's point and brings it into view, and lights the row
  and the other half of its pair. A click on a point lights it and its rows and scrolls the list to its
  newest row; the row under the pointer lights its own point while the pointer is there. A point stands
  for a spot about 110 m across, or for a whole charging place. A trip's or a charge's row opens it, and
  **← Events** there comes back to the list as it was.
- **Two frames make an event.** The cloud sends one-frame blinks — a door "open" for a single
  poll — so a change counts only once two consecutive frames hold it. A change the car reversed between
  two of its own reports is never seen, and the cloud can drop the lock signal for a poll or two, which
  then reads as a short unlock.
- **Filters**: a word (the event's name, a command's outcome, a place, where a trip started or ended or
  a charge happened — its name or its full address — or the note of a trip or a charge), the group pills (Security,
  Doors, Windows, Charging, Climate, Driving, Commands) and, under ⚙, a date range and single kinds.
  The filters live in the address, so a link or a reload keeps them.
- **History**: the events are derived from the positions Mate already stores, so on an existing install
  the first start reads the whole history back, a slice per poll, and until it is done the page says how
  far it got. Events are kept as long as the positions are (*Settings → Database*).

### Reports
**(menu: Reports)** — A summary **month by month**: how much you drove, how much energy you
used and charged, how much you spent. Handy for keeping an eye on the trend. It also carries the
**official consumption** cards (Today / This week / This month) from the cloud.

It always opens on the **month you are in**, even on the 1st with nothing driven yet — an empty
month says so rather than quietly showing you the previous one, and a month with nothing in it
shows no comparison against the one before (every figure would read −100 %, which describes the
calendar and not your driving).

**Where the consumption figure comes from, and when Mate overrules it.** *Average consumption* and
*Energy used* normally come from the car's own official total for the month. That total is only as
complete as your car's connection was: if the car couldn't reach the cloud during a drive, that
whole drive is missing from it. When the total comes back far below what Mate's own trips add up to
for the same month, Mate shows **its own figure instead** — the same one the Trips page shows — and
says so under the tile. The Guida / A·C / Altro split stays the car's own, with a line saying it
covers only the part that reached the cloud.

### Battery health
**(menu: Battery health)** — An **estimate of the state of health (SoH)** of the battery: how much
usable capacity is left compared to new. For each charge Mate divides the energy it **measured**
going into the pack (voltage × current, integrated over the session) by the percentage that charge
added. That ratio is an estimate of the whole pack's capacity, and its trend over time — or over
mileage, your choice — is what ageing looks like.

Three things about how it is worked out, because they change what the number means.


- **A quiet stretch no longer ages the battery 🆕** (#241) — capacity is measured as energy against
  the SoC that rose. Where the car stops reporting for more than a quarter of an hour, that energy
  is deliberately not counted (nobody knows what the charger did meanwhile), and **the SoC of the
  same stretch is now left out too**. Before, a charge with an hour of silence in it could read
  81 % where the pack was at 100 %.
- **Nothing changes on a normal connection.** Where your car reports as usual the figures are
  identical to a tenth; only charges that had real gaps in them move — upwards, to where they
  belonged.
- **It stops at 95 %.** On an LFP pack the voltage barely changes across the middle of the range, so
  the BMS **counts** charge instead of reading it, and drifts; near the top the curve finally rises
  and the BMS **re-anchors** — adding percentage points that no energy paid for. Counting those
  points would make the pack look smaller, and worst of all on a short top-up to 100 %, where they
  are most of the rise. So the arithmetic stops at 95 %: the charge itself still counts, only its
  last stretch is left out.
- **Bigger charges count more, in proportion.** The headline pools the energy and the percentage
  across recent charges rather than averaging them one for one, so a charge that spanned 50 points
  carries about four times the weight of one that spanned 13. Nothing is discarded to achieve it.
- **Cold charges are shown but excluded** — an LFP reads low when it is cold — as are charges that
  started nearly empty or that show the BMS jumping.

**The figure comes with a ± , and that is the honest part.** It is the **scatter** of the charges
behind it, not an accuracy: the energy is measured, but the percentage it is divided by is a number
the BMS counted, and that number drifts. A narrow band means your charges agree with each other, not
that the pack is certainly that size. With a single charge no ± is shown at all, because one
measurement has no spread to report.

It is an **estimate**, then — not a laboratory diagnosis — and it settles as charges accumulate.

### Maintenance
**(menu: Maintenance)** — The **maintenance due dates** for your car, based on the **official schedule
for your model** (T03, B05, B10, C10). For each service item (e.g. service, brake fluid, cabin
filter, tyres…) you see two progress bars: one for the **kilometres** and one for the **time**,
because whatever comes first is what's due.

- You can **log a service** ("done today at X km") directly from the page: the next due date is
  recalculated.
- For a **new car** that has no history yet, you can set a **reference date/mileage** so the due dates
  start from delivery ("first service in…") instead of showing up as "never done".
- The **registration / delivery date is now editable**: click the **✏️** next to the saved date to
  correct a mistake (the new value overwrites the old one).
- The distances respect the chosen unit (km or miles).

### Commands
**(menu: Commands)** — The **remote commands**. From here you can:

- **lock/unlock**, open the **trunk**, **find the car** (horn/lights);
- open or close the **sunshade** of the roof: the tile says how far it is open, and when it was
  stopped part-way it offers both **Open** (all the way) and **Close**, the only two the car acts on;
- manage the **climate**: cooling, heating, defrost, ventilation, **switch off**;
- activate **seat heating**, **steering wheel** and **mirror heating** (where supported);
- manage the **charge limit**.

The **climate card** now has a **temperature slider, a fan slider and a recirculation toggle** (fresh
air / recirculate). Each climate tile — **A/C AUTO · Cool · Heat · Vent · Defrost** — lights from the
car's **real mode**, with exactly one lit at a time (just like the official app). In the three
**manual** modes (**Cool / Heat / Vent**) you can set target temperature and fan speed: the car stays
in that mode and remembers the value. In **AUTO** the car manages fan and recirculation itself, so
those two controls show the current value but are **read-only** — the temperature stays adjustable.
**Rapid Ventilation** now reliably engages true ventilation (air only, no heat/cool) from any state.

When you send a command, Mate updates the interface immediately in an "optimistic" way and then
confirms on the next read. If the cloud accepts but the car doesn't confirm within a few seconds, you
see an **amber** notice ("sent, it may have worked") — it's not an error: the command often goes
through anyway (it depends on the car's coverage/standby).

### Scheduling
**(menu: Scheduling)** — The car's **schedules**:

- **Scheduled charging** (and the **charge limit**);
- **Scheduled climate** — 5 presets (cool / heat / ventilate / defrost / auto) with a future start
  time; you can create, edit and cancel them.

### Prepare car
**(menu: Prepare car)** — The "**pre-condition your car with one touch**" function: it brings the
cabin to the desired temperature (and the related functions) **right now** or at a **scheduled time**.
You can also turn everything off.

**🆕 Automatic on power-on** — Instead of tapping the button every time, you can let Mate run the
preparation **by itself the moment the car goes Ready** (powered on). Turn on **Automatic on power-on**,
choose once what it should do — climate preset and target temperature, how far to open the windows,
driver/passenger seat **heating or ventilation**, heated steering and mirrors — and save.

You can add an **optional condition on the interior temperature**: run the preparation **only when the
cabin is above** a value (e.g. pre-cool only when it's over 25 °C) **or only when it's below** one (e.g.
pre-heat only when it's under 5 °C). **Leave the condition off and it runs on every power-on**, whatever
the temperature. Two things to know about the condition: it looks at the **interior** temperature (the
car reports no outside temperature), and it's decided **once, at the instant you turn the car on** — so
if the cabin changes later during the drive, it won't fire a second time.

It runs **once per power-on** (it won't repeat while you stay on, or for a later trip in the same
driving session), it ignores brief signal glitches, and it never re-fires just because Mate restarted.

### Navigation
**(menu: Navigation)** — *Send a destination to the car's navigation* and **find nearby charging
stations**. The page has three parts:

- **Destination** — type an **address** (and, if needed, the **city**), press **Search**: the
  destination appears on the map and with **🧭 Send to car** you send it to the on-board navigation.
  *Searching by address requires a geocoding key* (see [Settings → Address lookup](#7-settings)).
- **⚡ Charging stations — "Find charging stations"** — searches for **public charging stations around
  the car** (using its current GPS position). You can set:
  - **Max distance** — 500 m, 1, 2, **5 km** (default) or 10 km;
  - **Results per page** — 25, 50 or 100;
  - **Network / operator** (optional) — to filter a specific provider (e.g. Electra, Ionity, Enel X
    Way, Be Charge, Plenitude, A2A, Atlante, Ewiva, Tesla…).

  The results appear both as **⚡ pins on the map** and in a **list** below, with **name, distance**
  and, where available, **real-time availability** (🟢/🔴 "available now", e.g. on the Italian public
  network). Tap a station in the list to **see it on the map**, and with a click you can **use it as a
  destination** and then send it to the car. If there's nothing within the chosen radius, Mate widens
  it and shows **the nearest ones**.

  > The station search **requires no keys** (it uses open maps + a public charging-station database);
  > the optional keys in *Settings → ⚡ Charging stations* (Open Charge Map, TomTom) enrich it. The car
  > does, however, need a known **GPS position**.
- **Car's current position** — the car's address and a map with its 🚗 pin.

### Vehicle
**(menu: Vehicle)** — The **full status** card for the car: all the sensors available on your model
(charge, range, inside temperature, gear, doors, windows, tyres, locks, charge status…), now also the
**climate detail**: **fan level** (1–7), **air recirculation** (fresh / recirculate) and the **active
climate mode** (AUTO / Cool / Heat / Vent). Mate shows **only what your car actually reports** (some
models don't expose certain data). The sunshade tile says how far it is open — "40%" over "Open" —
as the window tiles do.

### Wallbox
**(menu: Wallbox)** — If you've connected a wallbox (see
[Integrations](#8-the-integrations-in-detail)), here you see its **live** data (power, energy), the
**summary** and the list of **sessions**, and possibly the **controls** (e.g. max current) if your
wallbox exposes them through Home Assistant.

When your car is **not plugged in**, the card says so by name — *"C10 not connected"* — because a
wallbox can be charging somebody else's car and those live figures would not be yours. The cost tile
reads **Last home charge**: a charge is priced only once it ends, so that figure is never the session
in progress.

> In Mate "home" means **wallbox or domestic socket**, so a charge can carry that badge without your
> wallbox being involved at all.


---

## 7. Settings

**(menu: ⚙️ Settings)** — The page is organized into **accordion cards**: you open one at a time. It's
divided into three columns.

**Column 1 — Vehicle and driving**

- **🌍 Language & Currency** — the interface language, the currency for costs, the **units**
  (metric/imperial).
- **Vehicle** — your car's model, its VIN, and **which Leapmotor account this instance signs in
  with**. The account matters if you run Mate more than once — a second instance, a test one, one
  per car: model and VIN describe the *car*, so two instances watching the same car used to look
  identical from the inside. Here you also have the **🔓 Log out** button to link a different
  account: it deletes *only* the saved credentials, **not** your trips/charges nor the
  certificate.
- **Battery** — the **capacity** in kWh used for all calculations; correctable. If Mate has a
  "measured" estimate from your data, it offers it to you.
- **Polling Cadence** — how often Mate reads the status from the cloud, with two sliders: **parked**
  (10 s–5 min, default 30 s) and **driving** (10–60 s, default 10 s). Reading more often does not
  drain the car, but it generates more traffic to the cloud.
- **Charge detection** — the **current threshold** (in amperes) above which Mate considers it "charge
  in progress". Lower it only if you have very slow charges that go undetected.

- **Always charging at home 🆕** — with no wallbox and no Home Assistant there is nothing to tell Mate
  where a charge happened, so every session is born unclassified and has to be tagged by hand: a lot
  of identical clicks for someone who only ever charges at home, several short top-ups a day. With
  this on, a new charge is born **Home** and can still be changed afterwards for the rare public one.
  The **type** works forward only — charges from before you turned it on stay unclassified, exactly
  as they are — and turning it on asks for an explicit confirmation, so it can never happen by
  accident.
- **And priced, not only labelled 🆕** — a charge born **Home** used to arrive with the green badge
  and no cost, because the pricing engine only ever ran on a *confirmation*, by hand or from the
  wallbox. Being born already confirmed, it went through neither. It is now priced exactly as if you
  pressed its badge yourself — time-of-use bands read the hour of the charge, not the hour of now —
  and the ones already sitting there without a price are filled in too. A cost you typed is never
  overwritten, and a charge you marked free stays free.

**Column 2 — Integrations**

- **ABRP** — sending telemetry to A Better Routeplanner (see [§8](#8-the-integrations-in-detail)).
- **Address lookup** — the service that translates addresses ↔ coordinates on the Navigation page and names
  where your trips start and end and where you charge (Geoapify *recommended*, LocationIQ, TomTom). It
  requires a free **key** for the chosen service; without one, Mate uses the keyless OpenStreetMap service.
- **⚡ Charging stations** — enables the **station names** on charges (📍) and accepts optional keys
  (Open Charge Map, TomTom) to enrich the search. It's **off** by default.
- **Wallbox** — connect your wallbox for **real costs** and any controls (see
  [§8](#8-the-integrations-in-detail)).
- **MQTT → Home Assistant** — publishes the car's data as entities in Home Assistant (see
  [§8](#8-the-integrations-in-detail)).

**Column 3 — Data and maintenance**

- **🔐 Access** *(standalone Docker only — under the Home Assistant add-on, ingress already
  authenticates every request and the card isn't shown)* — a password to open Mate. Worth setting:
  without one, anything on your network can open Mate, and Mate can unlock your car.

  You type it **twice**, because there is nowhere to read it back afterwards — it's stored as a
  salted hash, never in clear text. **If you lose it**, you are not locked out for good: the *New
  password* box doesn't ask for the old one, so from any device still signed in you can simply set
  a new one. If no device is signed in any more, the `MATE_AUTH_PASSWORD` environment variable
  overrides whatever is stored. ⚠️ *Overrides*, not replaces: the forgotten hash stays in the
  database underneath, so once you are back in, set a new password (or clear it) in **Settings →
  Access** and only then remove the variable — remove it first and the forgotten one is in charge
  again.

- **Database** — the size of the DB and the **GPS retention**: you can keep the GPS points "forever"
  (default) or delete those older than 6/12/18/24 months to save space. *Only positions are pruned*:
  trips — with their route and the readings along it — charges and charge curves stay.
  The points of a drive still in progress stay until it ends, because its end is read from them.
- **Export / Backup** — download **trips (CSV)**, **charges (CSV)** and a **database backup**. The
  backup arrives **gzip-compressed** (`leapmotor_mate.db.gz`) 🆕, streamed in pieces so even a large
  database never has to fit in memory whole. Restore takes **both** the compressed file and a plain
  `.db` saved before this change, so nothing you already have stops working — and a smaller file is
  easier to keep or to sync wherever you back things up.
- **🩺 Diagnostics** — a snapshot of the system (version, model, counts, last poll, active
  integrations), the ability to **view the logs** (poller/web) and, above all, to **download a
  diagnostics bundle** by ticking the parts you want (info, poller log, web log, **raw signals**). The
  bundle is **already cleaned** of sensitive data: **GPS removed** and VIN/secrets masked, so it's
  safe to attach when you ask for support. The integrations line reports the **wallbox switch** and
  **Home Assistant** separately: the first says whether you have the feature ticked, the second only
  whether Mate can reach HA. There's also a **scan for missed charges** that happened while the car
  was asleep.

  🆕 **The sliders that change how Mate behaves now need a Save press.** Poll cadence, charge
  detection, the advanced thresholds: they used to save the instant you let go of the slider, so a
  finger dragging across one while scrolling a phone changed it without asking. The slider still
  moves freely; nothing is written until you press Save. **And every such change is recorded** —
  when, from what, to what — and shown in the bundle, so "it changed by itself" can be checked.

  🆕 The bundle now also carries **the rows themselves** — the charges and the trips of the last
  fortnight, straight from the database — and a section that lists **every time the battery filled
  up while parked** together with what Mate could see at that moment: whether the cable declared
  itself, whether Mate concluded it was charging, the current, and whether the data was arriving
  fresh or the cloud was repeating an old reading. None of it is new information about you: it is
  what Mate already recorded, finally written where support can read it. Still no positions.
- **⚙️ Advanced** — fine parameters for expert users: the minimum threshold to **reconstruct** a
  missed charge, the **vampire-drain** threshold, the kW threshold to distinguish **DC**, and the
  minimum temperature for the **battery-health** calculation. There's a button to **reset to
  defaults**.

> 🆕 When a new feature arrives, its card may show a **NEW** badge until you open it for the first
> time.

## 8. The integrations in detail

All the integrations are **optional** and **off** by default. They are configured from **Settings**.

### Wallbox (for the real charging costs)
By connecting your wallbox, Mate uses the **energy actually delivered** (on the alternating-current
side) to calculate the cost of home charges, instead of estimating it from the change in percentage.

Mate reads the wallbox **through Home Assistant**:

1. In *Settings → Wallbox*, turn on **Wallbox present**.
2. **If you use the Home Assistant add-on**, Mate can reach HA on its own: you don't need to enter an
   address or token.
3. **If you use Mate as standalone Docker**, enter the **Home Assistant URL** (e.g.
   `http://192.168.1.10:8123`) and an HA **long-lived access token**, then press **Test**.
4. With the **keywords** you can help Mate recognize the right entities of your wallbox (e.g.
   `wallbox, charger, evse, keba, pulsar`). Some known wallboxes (e.g. V2C Trydan) are recognized
   automatically; the "trap" entities (solar/home) are excluded.
5. Open the entity list to check that Mate has latched onto the right **energy/power** sensors.
6. **"auto home"** option: it automatically assigns the **Home** label to charges made on your
   wallbox.

### ABRP (A Better Routeplanner)
Sends the car's telemetry to ABRP for real-time trip planning.

1. In *Settings → ABRP*, turn on **Enabled**.
2. Paste your ABRP **token** (you'll find it in the "generic"/telemetry settings of your ABRP
   account).
3. Save. The integration's status appears in the card's header.

### MQTT → Home Assistant
Publishes the car's status (charge, range, position, doors, charge status…) as **entities in Home
Assistant**, with **auto-discovery**. You can also **command** the car from the HA entities — including a writable **Charge Limit** number to set the target SoC, a writable **Charge Schedule** text entity that takes a JSON plan for automations (`{"start":"23:00","soc":90}` — every key optional, and anything you omit keeps its current value), a writable **Fan Level** number (1–7) and a writable **Recirculation** switch, plus a **Climate Mode** sensor (AUTO / Cool / Heat / Vent). The published entities also include three read-only V2L ones: **`V2L Active`** (binary sensor), **`V2L Power`** (W) and **`V2L Session Energy`** (Wh), and a **`Ready`** binary sensor that turns on the moment the car is powered up — before it moves, which is when an automation still has time to act. A **`Sunshade Position`** sensor says how far the sunshade is open, in % (0 = closed); the binary **`Sunshade`** stays as it was, on for any opening.

Entities **your** car doesn't support aren't left on your hands: the ones the model lacks (heated seats,
steering wheel…) are never created, and a **temperature entity** whose sensor the car has never reported
is **removed** — not left on `unknown` for ever. The removal arrives when the evidence does (about half
an hour of updates), with no restart needed, and if the sensor starts answering the entity **comes back**.

Two more entities arrived recently 🆕: **Climate Power**, the watts the climate system is drawing
(so an automation can see the cabin being heated or cooled), and **Outside Temp**, the air
temperature from the weather — the latter only while that switch is on (see *Overview*).

And one more 🆕: **OTA Update Notice**, on when a software-update message is sitting in your
Leapmotor account inbox, with the message title and its date as attributes — enough for an
automation to notify you. Read it for what it is: the inbox belongs to the **account**, so with two
cars the same notice appears on both, and it says a message arrived, not that your car has an update
pending. Leapmotor publishes no update status, so there is no version number to show.

1. Get an **MQTT broker** ready (usually the *Mosquitto* add-on in Home Assistant).
2. In *Settings → MQTT*, turn on **Enabled** and fill in:
   - **Broker** (e.g. `192.168.1.10` or `core-mosquitto`) and **Port** (default `1883`);
   - the broker's **Username** and **Password**;
   - the topic **Prefix** (default `leapmotor`);
   - options: **Discovery** (recommended), **TLS** and **TLS insecure** if you use self-signed
     certificates.
3. Press **Test connection** to check the connection, then **Save**. Within a few seconds the
   entities appear in Home Assistant.

> For commands via MQTT, the car still requires the PIN: Mate uses it automatically with the saved
> credentials.

---

**If you run more than one Mate against the same broker 🆕** — the normal add-on and the BetaTester
one, say — give each a **different Topic prefix** (*Settings → MQTT*). On the same prefix, watching
the same car, they are **one device** to Home Assistant: the second appears not to work, and worse,
**every command is executed twice**. Mate now notices and says so; the BetaTester build moves itself
to a prefix of its own, the normal one never moves.

## 9. Demo mode

**Demo** mode lets you try Mate without a car and without an account: it starts with **a month of
fake but realistic data**. You can activate it in two ways:

- from the first-start wizard, with the **🧪 Try the demo** button;
- or by starting the container with the variable `MATE_DEMO=1`.

In demo: the data is openly fictitious (a **DEMO** badge), the commands are **simulated** (no car is
contacted) and a banner at the top stays visible at all times with the button to **exit**. When you
exit, Mate returns to the normal setup.

## 10. Frequently asked questions and troubleshooting

**The car often goes "offline" / I keep seeing "Invalid token".**
Almost always it's because the **same Leapmotor account is being used somewhere else** (the official
app, another integration, a second instance of Mate). Use an **account dedicated only to Mate** and
**change its password**, using it only here (so the other client is kicked out and can't get back in).
See [requirements](#2-before-you-start-the-requirements).

**A command gives a "timeout" / amber notice.**
It's (usually) not a Mate problem. The commands are *real-time* and depend on the **car's
reachability** (coverage, standby). Mate retries and the command often still goes through. The
**"Car responsiveness"** indicator in the Overview gives you an idea of the situation.

**Some trips or km are missing after an offline period.**
When the car was unreachable, some data may not have been recorded. Charges that happened "while
asleep" are usually **reconstructed** from the charge jump; for the lost km it isn't always possible
to recover them. The **missed-charge scan** (Settings → Diagnostics) helps find charges that weren't
recorded.

**I see a strange charge / an absurd cost.**
Mate has protections against impossible values (e.g. wallbox meters that report the lifetime total).
The opposite case is covered too: if the wallbox meter **stops** mid-charge while the car goes on
drawing power, Mate stops trusting its total for that session and bills on the energy that reached
the battery instead — the meter's figure would be short by whatever it missed while frozen. A third case joins those two: if a charge stays open for more than ten minutes with **no reading taken at all** — Home Assistant down, Mate restarted mid-charge — the total is not a measurement of that charge either, and the same thing happens. (The meter itself keeps being read while the **car's** cloud is unreachable: it is in your house, not behind it.) And an efficiency above 100 % is impossible, so it is never shown.
If a public charge has a complicated tariff, type the total paid in **✎ Manual**, at the bottom of
its type menu.

**The vampire-drain chart is empty.**
You need at least one **long stop** with a measurable drop in charge in the last few days. If the car
is always charging or sleeps while parked, there may not be enough material. Mate also captures the
drop that only "reveals itself" on wake-up.
Another frequent cause is the **vampire-drain threshold** in *Settings → Advanced*: if you raised it
above your car's real drops, the chart draws nothing. Bring it back toward **0.2** (or press
**Reset**) and the windows reappear. From **v1.22.4** the page tells you so explicitly — it still
shows the typical value and a "below your threshold" notice instead of looking empty.
From **v3.10.5** the chart is also followed by **the most recent discarded stop**, with its length,
its drop and the reason — so a chart that has not grown for days no longer reads as broken. Most
often the reason is that the car lost **0.1%**, one single step of its charge sensor: below that a
drop cannot be told apart from noise, and Mate would rather draw nothing than a number it invented.

**I have a Leapmotor REEV (hybrid with a range extender).**
Supported from **4.7.0**, on the ordinary build: the REEV page, the petrol per trip and per period,
and the REEV battery packs in the wizard. The BetaTester build is no longer needed for them.
The petrol figure is the car's own, taken from Leapmotor's per-trip history — the same number the
official app shows. Where the cloud has no record of a drive, Mate works the litres out from the tank
instead, and each figure says which of the two is on screen. The cloud's window is about 28 days, so
on a long history the older drives read the tank's answer, which measures about 20% lower.
A drive that burned nothing reads `0 L` with *all electric* beside it, which is not the same as a
drive whose tank could not be read — that one stays blank.
Not shown on a range extender: the **regen**, because a generator refilling the pack while you drive
cannot be told apart from braking.
Already running the BetaTester build? You do not have to move — it keeps working. If you want to, it
is a backup and a restore, in that order: see
[From the BetaTester build to the official one](BETA-TO-OFFICIAL.md).

**Mate receives no data, and I have a firewall (Synology or any other).**
Mate never needs to be reachable from outside. The only **incoming** rule it needs is TCP **4001**
from your own network, so that you can open the page. Everything else is **outgoing**: DNS on port
53, then HTTPS on 443 to `app-gw-global-master.leapmotor-international.de` and
`appgateway.leapmotor-international.de` — the same load balancer in AWS Frankfurt, whose addresses
rotate, so allow the names or the region and never pin today's addresses.
This is why adding ports or countries to a firewall profile changes nothing: those rules describe
**incoming** connections, and the cloud's answers come back on a connection Mate opened itself. What
stops it is the profile's final deny-all, applied to the traffic leaving the Docker bridge.
On a Synology, what worked ([#384](https://github.com/ProtossBlaster/leapmotor-mate/issues/384)):
read the container's own network — its gateway and address, for example `172.28.0.1` and
`172.28.0.2` — then create a rule allowing **all ports** for that whole range (`172.28.0.1` to
`172.28.255.254`) and move it to the **top**, above the others. The rest of the profile, deny-all
included, can stay exactly as it is.
From **4.7.18** a failed connection ends with one word in the log and on the setup page —
`dns_failure`, `connection_refused`, `timeout`, `network_unreachable`… — which tells you in one
glance whether the machine cannot resolve the name or cannot reach the address. From **4.8.0** that
word is no longer hidden by Mate's own "login temporarily deferred" message.

**I'm not in Europe.**
At the moment Mate only works with the **European** Leapmotor cloud. Accounts on servers in other
regions cannot log in.

**How do I make a backup?**
From *Settings → Export/Backup* you download the database (and the CSVs). Keep the DB **together with
its `secret.key`**.

## 11. Glossary

- **SoC** (*State of Charge*) — the battery's percentage of charge.
- **SoH** (*State of Health*) — the battery's state of health: capacity remaining compared to new.
- **AC / DC** — alternating current (slow charging, from home/AC stations) / direct current (fast and
  ultra-fast charging).
- **Home / AC / Fast (DC) / HPC / Free** — the charge types that Mate recognizes or that you can
  assign; a charge without one reads **✎ Manual** if you typed its price, **❓ To confirm** if not;
  "HPC" is very-high-power charging.
- **TOU** (*Time-of-Use*) — a **time-band** tariff (different prices by day/hour).
- **Regen** — energy **recovered** in braking/lift-off and put back into the battery.
- **Vampire drain** — what the car consumes while **completely switched off**, measured from power‑off
  to the next power‑on. It **includes remote heating/cooling done with the car off** (by design — car
  off → it counts as drain). Idle with the car *on* (parked, engine/climate running) is not counted here.
- **Polling** — the periodic reading of the car's status from the cloud (does not drain the car).
- **Wallbox** — your home charging station.
- **Poller / Web** — Mate's two internal components: the *poller* collects the data, the *web* shows
  the interface. For you as a user it's a detail: they work together.
- **VIN** — the car's chassis number; it uniquely identifies your vehicle.
- **Operation PIN** — the account's 4-digit PIN, needed to authorize remote commands.
