"""Which Leapmotor account is this instance using? — beta #13, @ebagnoli.

He runs several Mate instances against several Leapmotor accounts and asked whether Mate could
show which account a given instance is logged in with. It could not: the Settings "Vehicle" card
named the model and the VIN — both properties of the CAR — and never the login, so two instances
watching the same car looked identical from the inside.

The value has two homes and they are not interchangeable: the setup wizard writes it to
`settings`, while a dev or add-on install passes it in `LEAPMOTOR_USER` and the setting stays
empty. `get_account_user()` is the one definition of that precedence — the command client reads
the same function for its credentials, so the account the page names is the account Mate logs in
with, not a second guess at it.
