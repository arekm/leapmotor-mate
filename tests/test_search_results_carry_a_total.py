"""Search results carry a total, so a custom period can be read off them (discussion #263, @joeyoong).

His electricity is billed 22nd→21st, not by calendar month, and asked for the calendar to follow that
cycle. The date filters that select such a period already exist on both search forms — what was
missing is the SUM: the calendar's month strip totals its sessions, the search results listed cards and
totalled nothing, so any period other than a calendar month had to be added up by hand.

Same figures and same source as the month strips: `_billed_kwh` for the delivered side on charges,
`_totals_*` on trips — a total that disagreed with the calendar's would be worse than none.
