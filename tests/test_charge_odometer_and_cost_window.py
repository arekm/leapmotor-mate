"""#237 — the kilometres a charge carries, and the window the cost card divides over.

@nico89612 typed 152 charges into Mate from before he installed it, and the Statistics page told
him **4838.43 €/100 km**. Nothing was rounded wrong: the euros were summed over the whole archive
while the divisor came from the three trips the poller had managed to record — months of spending
over 46 km of one afternoon. The same card's kWh/100 km half was already windowed correctly, and
reproducing his 19.2 to the decimal is what proved the two halves were describing different years.

What is fixed here, and what is NEW:

  · the euros are counted over the window the KILOMETRES cover, never wider;
  · `charges.odometer_km` — written by the poller from the frame that opens a charge, typed on a
    manual one, back-filled once from `positions` for sessions already recorded;
  · the divisor may be the car's own odometer instead of Mate's reconstructed trips, but only when
    that prices MORE of what was actually spent — which is exactly the case the trips cannot speak
    for, and never an ordinary history;
  · re-importing a CSV FILLS IN the sessions already there instead of adding them a second time
    (before this, 152 charges became 304 in silence);
  · how far the car went between one charge and the next, which falls out of the column for free.
