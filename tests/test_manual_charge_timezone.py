"""Hand-entered charges are stored in UTC, like everything else (#181 ghuaywen-ai).

The renderer (`db_reader._local_dt`) reads a zone-less timestamp AS UTC and converts it to the display
zone. Both hand-entry paths — the Charges form and the CSV import — used to save the wall-clock text the
user typed, with no zone at all. So every manually added charge came back on screen pushed forward by
the user's whole offset: +7 h for the reporter, on all 150+ of his imported rows, and quietly wrong for
everyone outside UTC ever since the feature shipped.

The repair marks itself in the DATA rather than in a settings flag: a row that already carries a zone is
skipped. That is what makes it safe to run at every startup — and it is deliberately unlike the other
one-time repairs in this project, each of which trusts a flag that, if it ever goes missing, re-runs the
migration over already-migrated rows.

⚠️ That marker alone turned out to be half the story, and v2.12.1 shipped with only half. It is
idempotent but it freezes the zone in force at the first start after the update — and installing, then
choosing your zone, is the ordinary order of events. See the second half of this file.
