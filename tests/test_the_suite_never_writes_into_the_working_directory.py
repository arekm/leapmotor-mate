"""No test may open the database at its DEFAULT path — whatever happens to be there.

`db_reader.DB_PATH` and `Database()` both default to a RELATIVE "leapmotor_mate.db", resolved
against the current directory. Run the suite from the repo and 30 of its files created and wrote a
610 KB database there; run it from a directory where a real Mate database sits — a bind-mount
folder, a copy taken for triage — and those same tests write into that one instead.

Two costs, and the second is the one that bites:

  * tests share a database nobody reset between them, so what passes here can fail in CI (or pass
    for a reason that has nothing to do with the code under test);
  * a test suite must never be able to touch data it did not create.

conftest.py now points DB_PATH at a temporary file for the whole session, before anything imports
db_reader. This file is what keeps it true: it fails the moment the default is relative again, or
the environment stops being set.
